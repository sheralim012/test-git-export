<p><big class="xxlarge">About this course</big></p><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Welcome to 8.371.1x Quantum Information Science II, Part 1</big></b></p><p>
This course is part of a three-course-module series that addresses advanced topics in quantum computation and quantum information, including: </p><ul class="itemize"><li><p>
quantum error correction code techniques </p></li><li><p>
efficient quantum computation principles, including fault-tolerance </p></li><li><p>
quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory </p></li></ul><p>
 This course module will help you advance to the frontier of knowledge in the field, in preparation for discovering new things and solving problems in quantum information science and engineering. </p><p>
The three-course-module series comprises: </p><ul class="itemize"><li><p><b class="bf"><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-ii-part-1" target="_blank">8.371.1x:</a></b> Quantum states, noise and error correction </p></li><li><p><b class="bf"><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/efficient-quantum-computing-fault-tolerance-and-complexity" target="_blank">8.371.2x:</a></b> Efficient quantum computing - fault tolerance and complexity </p></li><li><p><b class="bf"><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-ii-advanced-quantum-algorithms-and-information-theory" target="_blank">8.371.3x:</a></b> Advanced quantum algorithms and information theory </p></li></ul><p>
Prior knowledge of quantum circuits and elementary quantum algorithms is assumed. A working understanding of quantum mechanics and familiarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a> is strongly recommended. </p><p>
A <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-i" target="_blank">first course-module sequence, 8.370x</a>, preceeded this, covering more introductory content, including the physics of information processing, quantum logic gates, quantum algorithms including Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm, quantum error correction, and quantum communication and key distribution. </p><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">The four sub-units of 8.371.1x Quantum Information Science II, Part 1</big></b></p><ul class="itemize"><li><p><b class="bf">Subunit 1: </b> [mathjaxinline]~[/mathjaxinline] <a href="/course/jump_to_id/lectures_m1_1" target="_blank">Quantum states and density matrices</a> </p></li><li><p><b class="bf">Subunit 2: </b> [mathjaxinline]~[/mathjaxinline] <a href="/course/jump_to_id/lectures_m1_2b" target="_blank">Quantum operations and distance norms</a> </p></li><li><p><b class="bf">Subunit 3: </b> [mathjaxinline]~[/mathjaxinline] <a href="/course/jump_to_id/lectures_m1_3" target="_blank">Quantum Error Correction</a> </p></li><li><p><b class="bf">Subunit 4: </b> [mathjaxinline]~[/mathjaxinline] <a href="/course/jump_to_id/lectures_m1_5" target="_blank">Stabilizers and Stabilizer Codes</a> </p></li></ul><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Textbook and Refernces</big></b></p><p>

This is an intermediate, graduate-level course, and you are expected to largely learn the material on your own. The discussion forums may be a good avenue for help from peers; there will be occasional (but not full-time) help from course staff, on the forums. </p><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Assessments and Deadlines</big></b></p><p>
This course module formally begins on Monday, May 21, 2018, and all the content is available immediately. Each of the four subunits has concept questions embedded within the lectures, and assessment problem sets, all of which are due before June 15, 2018. </p><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Grading and Certificates</big></b></p><p>
The course grade is determined entirely by the concept questions (30%) and problem sets (70%), with the following cutoffs: </p><ul class="itemize"><li><p>
90% : A </p></li><li><p>
80% : B </p></li><li><p>
70% : C </p></li></ul><p>
The minimum passing grade for a verified-ID certificate is <b class="bf">70%</b>. </p><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Honor Code</big></b></p><p>
As described in the <a href="https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service" target="_blank">edX Honor code</a>, you are expected to: </p><ul class="itemize"><li><p>
Complete all tests and assignments on my own, unless collaboration on an assignment is explicitly permitted. </p></li><li><p>
Maintain only one user account and not let anyone else use my username and/or password. </p></li><li><p>
Not engage in any activity that would dishonestly improve my results, or improve or hurt the results of others. </p></li><li><p>
Not post answers to problems that are being used to assess student performance. </p></li></ul><p><b class="bf"><big class="xlarge">Acknowledgements</big></b></p><p>
