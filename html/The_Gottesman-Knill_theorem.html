Fault-tolerant quantum computation is made possible by computing on quantum codes. For stabilizer codes, the class of allowed gates is defined by the Clifford group. The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that circuits from gates in the Clifford group may be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. </p>
