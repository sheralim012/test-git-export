  <p>
Which of the following statements are correct about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor_code#The_bit_flip_code" target="_blank">three-qubit bit-flip code</a>, and the three-bit classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code" target="_blank">repetition code</a>? Check all that apply: </p>

        <choice correct="false" name="1">
          <text>The three-qubit bit-flip code is decoded just like majority voting, by measuring the three qubits and computing the majority.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true" name="2">
          <text>The three-qubit bit flip code can also be used to correct phase flips, by applying Hadamard operators to the three qubits.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true" name="3">
          <text>The three-qubit bit-flip code must be decoded without measuring the encoded qubit.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false" name="4">
          <text>The three-qubit bit flip code can correct for single-qubit depolarizing errors.</text>
