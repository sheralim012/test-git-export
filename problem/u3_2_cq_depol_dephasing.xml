This is a concept question, provided to check your understanding of the previous video clip. </p>
  <p>
Which of the following statements about the dephasing channel and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_depolarizing_channel" target="_blank">depolarizing channel</a> are correct? Check all that apply: </p>

      <checkboxgroup>
        <choice correct="true" name="1">
          <text>The dephasing channel shrinks qubit states towards the z-axis of the Bloch sphere, whereas the depolarizing channel shrinks states to the center of the sphere.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false" name="2">
          <text>The dephasing channel and the depolarizing channel are identical up to a rotation of the qubit.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true" name="3">
          <text>The depolarizing channel is essentially dephasing along three directions.</text>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true" name="4">
          <text>The depolarizing and dephasing channels are both models of what can happen to a single qubit.</text>

        <choice correct="true" name="5">
          <text>The single-qubit fully mixed state [mathjaxinline]\rho =I/2[/mathjaxinline] is unchanged under both the depolarizing and the dephasing channels.</text>
