This is a concept question, provided to check your understanding of the previous video clip. </p>
  <p>
Prof. Chuang described in lecture how syndrome measurement for the three-qubit bit-flip code can be done by measuring the operators [mathjaxinline]U_1 = ZZI[/mathjaxinline] and [mathjaxinline]U_2 = IZZ[/mathjaxinline]. Which of the following statements about this syndrome measurement are correct? Check all that apply: </p>
