0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I'd like to take a few minutes to define a mechanism

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
known as operator measurement.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And this is what we will employ for measuring the syndromes

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of these quantum codes.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The definition starts with this scenario,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that you're given a unitary matrix, U,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which has eigenvectors U plus minus with eigenvalues

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
corresponding to plus and minus 1.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Can somebody name an example of such a unitary matrix?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
X.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
X. Yes.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In fact, all the polymatrices are such Us.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But not just single qubit polymatrices--

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
also X tensored X or X tensored with Z.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So all the combinations of polymatrices

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
also satisfy this class of unitary matrices.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And then I define measuring U as being the execution

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of the following circuit.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I start with a 0 here, and then I'll

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
assume that my input state, psi, happens

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to be some superposition C0 of U plus plus C1 of U minus.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And this comes in in the second qubit

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
or qubits register over here.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This may be more than one qubit.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It may be a three qubit state, it may be a 50 qubit state.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And what I'll do is I'll apply a controlled U

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
operation on this register of qubits

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
down here that's in some unknown superposition of the plus

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and the minus U eigenstates.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I then perform a second Hadamard gate

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
after this, following the first Hadamard gate.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I measure.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And then we get some output state over here.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000


35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's call this output stake psi.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And let's call this measurement result Z.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
OK, so what happens when we do this operator measurement

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
circuit?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's label some of these states.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So if this is psi 1, let's say, and this is psi 2,

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and then at the output here we have, let's call this psi 3,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
before the measurement.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And work out what this is systematically.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So psi 1 is right after the Hadamard,

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so we have 0 plus 1 divided by root 2.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to drop the normalizations

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for just a moment.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They should be straightforward to figure out.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And then the initial state--

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
C 0 U plus plus C 1 U minus.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Psi 2 is the state after the controlled U operation,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
right here.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So let's apply a controlled U. The control does nothing

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
when the first qubit is a 0.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000


56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then when the first qubit is a 1,

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
it applies the U operation.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So a U operation does nothing to U plus, because U plus

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
is the plus 1 eigenstate of U. But what does it

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
change U minus to?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Minus U minus.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we get a minus C1 U minus.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000


64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Psi 3 changes 0 to 0 plus 1, leaves that part alone,

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
changes 1 to 0 minus 1, like so.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But it's convenient to reorganize this and regroup it

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
by pulling out 0.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So if we pull out the 0 case, we get this plus this.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So the U minus terms cancel out.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And in fact, given the square root

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
of 2 normalizations and everything,

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
there are two square roots of 2 in the denominator.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's a factor of 2 from adding these two terms.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Those cancel out.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So we actually get 0 C0 U minus, and then 1 C1 U plus.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And this is a U minus.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000


78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
OK?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So now, if we measure this state,

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
then we get something interesting and useful.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000


82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When Z is equal to 0--

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that's the measurement result of this first qubit--

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
then the output state, psi, is equal to U plus.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And with what probability does that happen?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000


87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
[INAUDIBLE] to C0 squared.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
C0 squared.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000


91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then, when Z is equal to 1, the measurement result is 1,

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
then we project the state into U minus.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And this happens with probability C1 squared.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we have now a circuit which projects an unknown state

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
into the plus 1 eigenspace or the minus 1 eigenspace

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of some unitary operator, which is kind of cool and very, very

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
useful.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
