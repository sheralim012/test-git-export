1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In 8.371, we're going to talk about how to think about noise.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So noise is fundamental for classical and quantum

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
computing.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If your cell phone sends a message to the cell tower,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then your cell phone is using error correcting codes

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to protect the information.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For quantum computing, this is an even more necessary part

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of building a quantum computer.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The reason why after quantum computers were proposed

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and people have been working on it in the lab for a long time,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we still don't have them is because

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of the difficulty of contending with noise and quantum systems.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So this is a central part of building

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a quantum computer is dealing with noise,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and what you can do with quantum error

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
correcting codes also connects to many other interesting

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
fields, such as topological order in condensed matter

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
systems, understanding quantum key distribution,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a number of things where the connection is not

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
at all immediately obvious.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So we will talk about error correction in greater detail,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and fault tolerance, fault tolerant quantum computing.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000


24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We will also study quantum complexity theory,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is the study of which problems

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
are amenable to quantum speed up, and which problems are not.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One particular topic, which is becoming experimentally

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
relevant today which we'll cover,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
is quantum supremacy, which is the goal of building a quantum

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
computer that can do something that no classical computer can,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and in a sense this is always the goal of quantum computing.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Quantum supremacy focuses on achieving this

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
with a circuit that may not be useful for anything else.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's sort of the very first bar that a post classical computer

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
can achieve.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And complexity theory lets you achieve

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
this in a way that is, I think, rather surprising.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It let's make a somewhat indirect argument about why

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
some very near-term quantum circuits cannot be simulated.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So we'll talk about that next.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We'll talk about more advanced quantum algorithms.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So we'll talk about quantum walks, Hamiltonian simulation,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
linear system of equations, and other quantum algorithms.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And finally, we'll talk about quantum information theory.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And so many of the breakthroughs of classical information

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
theory from Shannon, such as using entropy

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
to describe compression, and noisy channel coding,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
all have quantum analogs, and these

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
are useful not only for dealing with quantum noise,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but also have connections to things like condensed matter

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
theory, understanding the holographic principle

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
for black holes.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's increasingly wide ranging applications

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
of quantum information theory, which I will briefly allude to,

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but mostly I'll give you the foundations of this field

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
