00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The repetition code is also an example of a linear code.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So let's say my code is just all zero

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
string and the all one string.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Of course, this is a subset of F2 to the n.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's see what these objects look like.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000


7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So my generator matrix just consists

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of a single column of all 1s.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is also equal to my sole generator, G1.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so my code is just the span of this G1, namely,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the one-dimensional vector space that contains it.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So it just has the 0 vector and this vector G1.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So this is a very simple subspace of F2 to the n,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of dimension 1.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And it suggests there's another way

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can describe this as well.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000


18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can describe it by linear equations over F2.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So these linear equations looks like, I

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
have X1 through Xn in the code.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is true if and only if X1 equals X2,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
X2 equals X3, and so on, down to Xn minus 1 equals Xn.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000


24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
OK?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In other words, all of the entries should be equal.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000


27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And then I can rewrite that in a more standard form.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Instead of X2 equals X2, I can write X1 plus X2 equals 0.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And here, your instinct would be X1 minus X2 equals 0.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But over F2, plus and minus are the same.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, easier just write plus.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I get X2 plus X3 equals 0, down to Xn minus 1 plus Xn equals 0.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And now, this looks like a linear system of equations

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in a standard form.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can write this as some matrix H times x

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
equals 0, where H is this matrix 1, 1, all 0s, 1, 1,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
all 0s, and so on.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It just has two 1s per row and they wrap around.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
