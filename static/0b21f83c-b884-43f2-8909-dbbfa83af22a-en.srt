1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you want to talk about quantum channels in the most

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
generality, they are actually completely positive

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
space-preserving maps, and they are really complicated, even

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to write down the definition.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, maybe not to write down the definition,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but to intuitively--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
they're really quite difficult to understand.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And if you want to learn about them,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you can take the follow up to this course,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is 8371, or 18436.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But today, we'll tell you the simplest kind

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of quantum channel, which is all the kind, which is--

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean, we can do everything we want to in this course

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with that kind of channel.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So what is a quantum channel?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000


17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So what we're going to do is we're

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
going to express a quantum channel as a mixture

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of simple channels.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000


21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Probabilistic mixture simple channels.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000


23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So that's not always true, but let's do the easiest one first,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
what we'll call the dephasing channel.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000


26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let's say, with probability 1 minus p, you do nothing.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000


28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Probability p, apply sigma z.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000


30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So let's put a quantum state into the depolarizing channel.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So suppose you put in alpha 0 plus beta 1.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You get out a mixture.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You get out 1 minus p, probability alpha 0,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
plus beta 1.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And with p probability, you get out alpha 0 minus beta 1.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000


37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And from last time's lecture, we know

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
this can be expressed as a density matrix,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so the density matrix is 1 minus p alpha 0 plus beta 1, alpha 0

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
plus beta 1 plus p.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Same thing with minus signs.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000


43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And that's 1 minus p, alpha squared.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000


45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's assume alpha and beta are real, because--

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000


47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
alpha beta, alpha beta, beta squared.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000


50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because otherwise, we get a whole bunch

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of complex conjugates, which I don't want to mess up.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000


53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, down here, you get alpha 0 minus beta 1.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That gives you alpha squared minus alpha beta

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
minus alpha beta, beta squared is equal to--

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000


57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
well, 1 minus p alpha squared plus alpha squared.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
p alpha squared is just alpha squared.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000


60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And the same thing for beta squared.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And you have 1 minus 2p alpha beta and--

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000


63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
OK, I'm going to rewrite that down here.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alpha squared, 1 minus 2p alpha beta, 1 minus 2p alpha beta,

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
beta squared.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the density matrix we put in was alpha squared, alpha beta,

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
alpha beta, beta squared.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So the depolarizing channel, you can see from this example,

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and this example is--

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
well, this is as general as possible,

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
really, except you also should check that it works

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
with alpha and beta complex.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what the depolarizing channel does

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is it multiplies the alpha diagonal elements

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
of the density matrix--

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
sorry, the dephasing channel.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The dephasing multiplies the alpha diagonal elements

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
of the density matrix by some constant.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
