00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The way we'll derive these conditions

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is by remembering that conjugation by U

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
preserves the commuting or anti-commuting structure.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And remember that whether two polys commute or anti-commute

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
can be described in terms of the symplectic inner product.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we can write sigma v sigma w sigma v--

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this kind of a compact way of saying whether they

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
commute or anti-commute.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So this is always going to be plus or minus identity.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Right?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Because when I move this sigma v past sigma w,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to pick up either a plus sign or a minus sign.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And then everything cancels, and I'm just

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
left with plus or minus identity.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And so this is going to be minus 1

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to the v transpose lambda w times identity,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
where lambda is this block matrix.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000


19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
OK, so these are the commutation relations.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000


21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And when we derived them, we did this

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
by actually calculating kind of a simpler equation-- sigma v

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
times sigma w, we found was sigma v plus w.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And here you have a phase that isn't this symmetric thing.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It just comes from moving the--

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so here we have x to the something,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
z to the something, x to the something, z to the something.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And we have to move the x's and w pass the z's and v.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And so we get a phase that looks like v transpose 0 identity 0,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
0, w.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So this picks out the x part of w and the z part of v.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we have these relations from before

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
of how you can multiply polys and what phases you get.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And we can use these to put constraints

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
on the possible f's and g's that can

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
come from Clifford operations.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So let's see how this works.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000


40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So let's suppose we do U sigma to the v plus w U dagger.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OK, so v and w are just some vectors.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This corresponds to some poly.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to conjugate it by U, where

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
U is a Clifford operation.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we can evaluate this in two different ways.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000


47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
On the one hand, we can use this formula.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And so we get that this is minus 1 to the f of v plus w

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
sigma to the g of v plus w.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000


52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
On the other hand, we can use this equation here to unpack

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
sigma v plus w as a product of sigma v times sigma w times

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
some [? phase. ?] So this is also equal to minus 1 to the v

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
transpose [? 0i ?] [? 00w, ?] u sigma v sigma w u dagger.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OK, I've just replaced sigma v plus w,

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
sigma v sigma w, and I pick up this [? phase. ?]

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the reason to do this is now I can insert in here--

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I left a little space so I could write u dagger u.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So let's do that, u dagger u.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000


62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we've inserted this.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And now what do we have?

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We have u sigma v u dagger.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then similar for w-- u sigma w u dagger.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And again, we can apply this formula here.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And we get out terms involve f of v, f of w, g of v,

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and g of w.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So let's see what this looks like.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This looks like minus 1.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We have a bunch of stuff in the exponent here.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We have this commutation relation.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We have f of v, f of w.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000


75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then each of these become sigma g of v sigma g of w.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
