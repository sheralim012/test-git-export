1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You know, I should probably call this the trace distance

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
or the trace norm.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's called the trace norm because if the matrix is PSD

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
then it corresponds to the trace.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's another way you can think about this.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can also write this as one half the trace

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of the absolute value of rho minus sigma.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And what I mean by the absolute value of rho minus sigma

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is take the spectral decomposition

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and replace all the eigenvalues with their absolute values.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So that's another way you can define this.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is also called the nuclear norm.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know where that one comes from,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but it goes by a few different names.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So if you've seen compressed sensing for matrices,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
they also use S1 they just have a different name for it.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And they use it for rectangular matrices.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OK so on the p set you'll show actually

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
a tighter version of this, which is the t of rho sigma

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is the maximum over m of this difference.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I just gave an upper bound.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
On the p set you'll show this is actually tight.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the trace distance actually corresponds

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to the best- To how distinguishable

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
these are by any measurement.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And what this means is it gives an operational meaning

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of this distance.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And there's one very nice consequence

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
of this, which is it lets you imagine

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
this includes any kind of measurement scenario.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So in particular, suppose my measurement scenario is, here

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
it is do the optimum measure, but suppose

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
instead I apply some channel, some noisy quantum operation,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and then I do the optimal quantum

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
measurement on those states.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So then the distinguishability would

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
look like the trace distance between end

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
of rho and n of sigma.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So I do n and then I apply the optimal measurement

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for those states, n of rho and n of sigma.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So this will give me some distinguishability.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And since it is among the menu of options

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that I already had for rho and sigma,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it's got to be covered by this maximum, right.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I could do this, that's one of the things

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm maximizing over.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So it would be no better than the original optimal

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
measurement for rho and sigma.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So this is less than or equal to t of rho and sigma.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In other words, if I have two states with some distance,

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
doing a quantum operation to them

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
can never make them further apart.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It might leave a distance the same

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
or it might bring them closer together.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In an extreme case, I can have a channel that

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
always outputs the same thing.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In which case it drops the distance down to zero.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or I could do unitary, which would leave them equally far

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
apart, or something else that leaves them equally far apart,

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
or something in the middle that reduces their distance,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but doesn't drop it to zero.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I'll never increase the distance.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is another feature of the not- Sorry,

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
of the linearity of quantum mechanics.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I could increase the distance of two states,

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it turns out all the crazy consequences

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
of non-linear quantum mechanics already come from that.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000


69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And so geometrically I can think of,

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
let's say here is my block ball, let's just think about cubits

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
where I can draw it.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000


73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah?

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000


75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Exactly.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000


77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is for n of quantum operation.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So if I have the block ball and I act with n,

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in general it's going to squash it down.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So we say that trace distance is contractive under quantum

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
operations.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are other measures we'll later

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
see that are also contractive.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Anything with a kind of operational significance to it

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
should have this contractive property.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000


87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah?

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
[INAUDIBLE]

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
[INAUDIBLE]

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000


92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, so let's say, the question was about,

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
suppose you have identity over two and then some pure state.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're asking can we distinguish them?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000


96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OK.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tell me the state.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You want super position of zero and one?

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So that super position is just another pure state out here.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So in all these cases, we can distinguish them with,

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
not with probability one, but with some bias.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So whenever you're distinguishing,

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you have to choose the sort of type one and type two errors.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Maybe you guess that it's I over two,

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but it was actually the other state or vise versa.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And if you want to balance these errors,

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you could be right three quarters

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
of the time in this case.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So you can measure- So you get some distinguishing ability.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000


112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Any other questions about trace distance?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000


115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So the key thing I want you to take away from this

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is that the distinguishability will shrink.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It will never increase.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And so, when we want to protect against noise, all we're doing

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is slowing down the rate of noise.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We can never reverse noise.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're just slowing down the rate at which our states move closer

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to each other.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
However, sometimes we can slow it down quite a lot.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
