00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I claim that any quantum operation

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:17,000
can be written as an isometry, then partial trace.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we started off with quantum operations

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
being an unlimited composition of unitaries,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
adding systems, and partial trace.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now I'm saying you just need to do

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
one isometry and one partial trace, and then you're done.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So this is something that gives us

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
something almost simple enough that we can often

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
use it in calculations.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me write down what this looks like.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000


13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So we start off with a system A, and we're

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
going to have an isometry V acting on it.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Since we're going to trace out part of the output,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
let's map this system A to a tensor product of spaces,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the part that we're going to keep

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and the part that we're going to throw away.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And now, here's where the channel language comes in.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We often think of A as being someone

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
who's sending information.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we'll give her a name.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Call her Alice.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And she'll send it to someone who is going to get system B.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So it's natural to name that person Bob.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000


27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And then there's another part, a part which will get traced out.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So we're going to send Alice's system into the tensor

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
product of Bob's system, and system E, which in some cases

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
can be the environment.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Or in cryptography, it corresponds to an eavesdropper,

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
which is convenient.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Either way, it's labeled by letter E.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if there's a person involved, it's the person Eve.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So you have isometry like this, and then

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we'll do the partial trace where we trace out system E.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So the formula for the quantum operation

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is, we do the partial trace on system E of V rho V dagger,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
meaning that we start with a state in system A.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This maps it to something on B and E. We trace out E,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and we're left with something just in Bob's system.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So this is a map from input space A to output space B.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000


44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So that's a nice, simple form.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't have to consider an unlimited number of isometries.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I just do one isometry, and then a partial trace.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And this to give me a quantum channel.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000


49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But why is it true?

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So why should it be true that I can always do a quantum

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
operation in this form?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't have to worry about arbitrary compositions

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
with a 1.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So finally, we have Form One of quantum operations,

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
an isometry followed by a partial trace.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
