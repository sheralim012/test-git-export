00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Before I give examples, I want to prove one more thing

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
about them.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So what I've derived is that if you have an isometry--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you have a quantum channel defined

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by an isometry, and then a partial trace,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then there exists also a Kraus operator description of it.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To be complete, we should go in the other direction as well.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We should say if I have a quantum channel described

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
by Kraus operators, satisfying the Kraus operator condition,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
then that's equivalent to one of that form,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that there exists an isometry.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So conversely, given a set of Kraus operators, and of rho,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this map should be a valid quantum operation.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000


16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Does anyone see why that should be true?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I satisfy these conditions, why

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
should that imply that I can also write it in this form?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000


20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, right.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The comment was, I can construct V as follows,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm given these Ve.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I could just write down the corresponding V.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then I claim this is an isometry.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why is that?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, I'm just running the same argument backwards

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that I had over here.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I start with this condition, and then this

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
is the Kraus operator condition.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is also equal to what I get from V dagger V.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So if I satisfy the Kraus operator conditions,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
then the V I've written down over there must be an isometry,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and it also corresponds to this quantum channel.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So everything I did, basically, you could run either forward

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
or backwards to map between these two different pictures.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
