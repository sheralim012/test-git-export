00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We have described quantum mechanics

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
using four postulates.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
However, for quantum error correction we need more.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We need classical statistics.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Consider this question.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With probability 1/2 you were given either psi or phi.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How do you describe this state?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is not a single quantum state, but rather

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a statistical combination of two possible states

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with equal probability.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You may recall that in quantum mechanics

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
this is described by a density matrix.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here it is the sum of the two outer product

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
vectors of the quantum state.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We call this rho.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To further appreciate the need for density matrices

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in describing stochastic combinations of quantum states,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
consider the following scenario.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have a two-part state-- psi AB--

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and this state we may draw as this quantum circuit which

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
originates from a single place.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The two qubit state will be this particular superposition,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and have parts A and B. A will be the first label

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and B will be the second label in each of the kets.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The question is, suppose B measures B's part of the state.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What describes A's part of this bipartite quantum state?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This state will be a statistical mixture,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because what A obtains differs depending

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
on what B's measurement result. If B measures a 0,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
then A has a 0.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If B measures a 1, A has a 1.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And each one of these happens with a different amplitude,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so we get one or the other of these two states

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
with the two different amplitudes.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let us call this statistical mixture Mixture 1.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And now, imagine another separate scenario.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In this scenario, B measures, but in a different basis,

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
rather than in this computational 0 and 1 basis

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
as shown above.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have the same bipartite state as an input

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to this quantum circuit.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
B, before measurement, let us say,

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
performs a Hadamard transform.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The question, again, is what is A's state?

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A will see something that we may interpret as being different,

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
depending on what B's measurement result is.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The state before B's measurement is written here.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It is a superposition where the second ket has had a Hadamard

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
operation applied to it.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And therefore we can read off from this

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
what A's state is going to be.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A will see when B measures a 0 a superposition of root 3 over 4

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
|0> and root 1 over 4 |1>.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If B measures a 1 instead, A's state

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
will be different, with a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, this is another statistical mixture.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And the mixture is of these two states-- one with a plus

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and one with a minus-- and they are superpositions in contrast

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to Mixture 1.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let us call this Mixture 2.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And, certainly, it looks very different from Mixture 1.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000


63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The question is, how are these two statistical mixtures

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
different?

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or might they be the same mixture in some sense?

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000


67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
To answer this question, we will need

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to turn to the definition of the density matrix.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For the statistical mixtures we have written here

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
using this circle plus as an or sign, the density

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
matrix is defined as the sum over the outer product of each

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
of the elements in this statistical mixture,

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
as given here.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We call rho the density matrix.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000


76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let us explore some sample density matrices.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Recall that the state 0 is a two component vector 1 0,

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and the state 1 is 0 1.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The density matrices corresponding to these

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
are given by the outer products, so 0

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
is 1 0 0 0, and 1 is 0 0 0 1.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The cross term 0 1 has the 1 in the upper right hand corner.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And this is easy to understand by labeling the rows

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and columns appropriately, with 0 on the left and on the top.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000


86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You may also explicitly multiply the column and row vector

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to obtain this matrix form.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000


89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Using these matrices, we may now write out

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the density matrices which correspond to the mixtures

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that we have studied.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The first statistical mixture-- let

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
us call it rho 1-- turns out to be the density matrix given

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
by this sum.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
3/4 of 1 and 1/4 of 1 gives you 1/4 times 3 0 0 1.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The second statistical mixture is

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
where we need the cross terms because the states are

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
superpositions.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
These cross terms give rise to off-diagonal elements

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in the density matrix.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Summing, as before, we find, though,

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
something very interesting.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The result is the same density matrix as for Mixture 1.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We conclude from this that the two are actually

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the same state.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
More about this can be understood

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
by returning to the formalism of density matrices.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me begin by defining a density matrix.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A density matrix is a matrix rho which

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
has two particular properties.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
First, the trace of rho must equal 1.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Second, the density matrix rho must be positive.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In other words, for all possible states that one might choose,

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the expectation value of rho must be real and greater than

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or equal to 0.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How do I construct a density matrix from states?

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
First, let me make this claim, that a density matrix may

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
be constructed from a probabilistic combination

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
of pure states.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
P, here, is a probability.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Psi are states which for now let us take to be orthogonal.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We may prove that this statistical combination

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is a density matrix by checking the two constraints.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
First, we note that its trace is equal to 1,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
since Ps are probabilities.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And second, it is clear that the matrix is positive.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So we can construct density matrices this way.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In the reverse direction, given a density matrix,

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
how can we interpret it?

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, I claim that any density matrix

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
rho can be expressed as a stochastic combination

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
of pure states.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that is exactly in the form we

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
have just seen, using a stochastic combination

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
of pure states.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let us prove this claim as follows.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
A density matrix is positive, and thus it

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
has a spectral decomposition into eigenvalues

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and eigenvectors.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And this spectral decomposition gives us exactly what we want.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We may see this straightforwardly

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
by writing out the spectral decomposition with lambda sub k

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
being the eigenvalue for state k.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Note that the trace is 1, and thus the eigenvalues

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
must sum to 1, meaning they are a probability distribution.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They are also real-valued, and rho

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is positive by construction.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This decomposition-- known as an unraveling--

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
allows us to consider some useful definitions.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Rho is known as being pure when its decomposition results

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in a single pure state alone.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Otherwise, rho is known as being a mixed state,

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
meaning that it is a stochastic combination

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
of multiple pure states.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OK, given these two constructions

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
let's consider a quick question.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How about a stochastic combination of density

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
matrices, given Ps as probabilities and rhos

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
as density matrices.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is this combination a legal density matrix?

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is a simple thing to work out.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The answer is yes.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So try it yourself and see if you can prove this to be true.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The concept of unraveling a density matrix

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
into a stochastic combination of pure states

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
was considered by von Neumann and is very interesting.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is an important lemma about unravelings.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let rho be unraveled as a stochastic combination

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
with probabilities P and states psi.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It turns out that this unraveling is not unique,

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
in general, for mixed states.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For a mixed state the density matrix

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
may also be unraveled with probabilities P and states phi,

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
under the following condition.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That is, that the square root-- in a sense--

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
of this decomposition-- square root of P and state psi--

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
is related by a unitary transform

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to the other decomposition, with square root of q and states phi.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The physical origin of this infinity of possibilities

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
of unravelings may be interpreted

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
as arising from the fact that it doesn't matter which

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
basis B measures in, in the original scenario we started

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
out our discussion with today.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000


185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let us now turn to another definition.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We will say that a purification of a density matrix

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
rho sub A is a state psi sub AB-- a pure state-- such

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that rho sub A is obtained by taking the partial trace over B

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of the density matrix given by the pure state.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This partial trace operation removes the degrees

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
of freedom associated with B, and can

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
be viewed in terms of the quantum circuit

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that we started out today with.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Namely, that we have a bipartite system,

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and the B part of the system is measured,

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
leaving rho sub A as the final state.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This concept of having infinite unravelings,

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and the interpretation of density matrices

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
in purified forms will be key ideas

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
in understanding the intuition behind quantum error correction.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
