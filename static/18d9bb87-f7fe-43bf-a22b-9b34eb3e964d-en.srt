0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's give some examples.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So one of them I mentioned, which is N of rho is equal to,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
let's say, U rho U dagger, just unitary evolution, right?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We should always make sure that these basic ones

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
fit within our model.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So here there's a single Kraus operator, which is U. Right?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And then you can check U dagger U is equal to identity.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So unitary evolution fits this model.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000


10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
OK, what about something a little bit more complicated?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000


12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Suppose I have random unitary evolution.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this was the type of noise considered in 8 370.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I apply a unitary, but I draw it from some probability

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
distribution.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So with some probability I apply U1, with some probability

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I apply U2, et cetera.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So what are the Kraus operators in this case?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So now the Kraus operators are square root of p sub e times U

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
sub e.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When you put it into the sum, the U e dagger U e

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
just becomes identity.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And the crucial thing to remember

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
is that we have to have square root, because it

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
shows up twice.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So then we get sum over e of p sub e, which just adds up to 1.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
OK, so I haven't fully erased this

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
for a reason, which is now it's time

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to talk about partial trace.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000


32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So if I trace out system b, then I've written this formula here.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And you'll notice this already has the Kraus form.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Right?

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This partial trace, I've written it

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
as a sum over some set of a matrix on the left side

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and the dagger of that matrix on the right-hand side.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
OK, so already that that is in Kraus form.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The only thing to check--

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
let me erase this down here.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000


42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So in other words, let me call it V sub b,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is identity tensor ket b.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is identity on Alice.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So we can just check that sum over b of V b dagger V b

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is equal to sum over b of--

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000


48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
oh, whoa, sorry.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is-- the V b acts on the left.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So this should be bra b.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000


52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So this sum here is sum over b of identity, tensor ket

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
b [AUDIO OUT] b.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The sum also gives us the identity.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So what we're left with is identity on Alice,

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
tensor identity on Bob.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So we can check that the conditions here are satisfied

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
by these Kraus operators.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is something that you of course cannot render

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
as a mixture of unitaries.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It doesn't even preserve dimension.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But there are other ones that do preserve dimension that you

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
still cannot write as a mixture of unitaries.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
One crucial feature about unitaries

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
is that if you act on the maximally mixed state, the one

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
proportional to identity, it leaves you

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
with the maximally mixed state.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And so that can be thought of as infinite temperature dynamics.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If I'm in counter--

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
if a bath has infinite temperature,

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
then every state is equally likely

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
when I am in counter with it.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And so if I thermalize with an infinite-temperature bath,

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
then I will thermalize to a state

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
where each energy level is equally likely.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But if I thermalize with a finite-temperature bath,

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
then the lower energy levels will

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
have more population in them than the higher energy levels.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So when I cool the water in this bottle,

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
hopefully there's more probability

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
of being in the lower energy states.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And a mixture of unitaries is not going to do that.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So one thing that's sort of the ultimate refrigerator

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
is to map everything to a pure state.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So let's consider that example.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
N of rho is just the zero state.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So this is something which is far

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
from the mixture of unitaries paradigm,

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but is crucial if we want to, say, initialize a quantum

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
computer.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right?

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So you get some qubits that come in, maybe hot,

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you want to cool them down, put them all in the zero state--

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that is the operation that you want to do.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So what are the Kraus operators for it?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's say that the input is a qubit,

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
then there are two Kraus operators.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's call them--

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
V0 is the ket 0 bra 0.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
V1 is ket 0 bra 1.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And so you can check that V0 rho V0 dagger plus V1 rho V1

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
dagger--

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you can verify that if you put these in you

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
will always get output 0, regardless

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
of the initial state.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I won't go through that calculation,

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but it's worth doing yourself if you

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
want to solidify this concept.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000


111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And there are others which I will put off

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to the problem set.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000


114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One very important channel is called

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the depolarizing channel.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And this one you can write as a mixture of unitaries,

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
although I won't mention how to do it.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And in this one, you've taken a state which is a qubit state.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
With probability p you do nothing.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You leave it alone.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And with probability p, you throw out the state

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and replace it with a maximally mixed one.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you can think of this as the simplest

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
model of kind of white noise affecting your qubit.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
With probability p, your qubit is completely

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
destroyed and replaced by a totally random one.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So when we talk about correcting quantum errors,

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this is not always the most physically realistic noise

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
model, but it's kind of the mathematically simplest one.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you first worry about fixing depolarizing noise,

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you're on your way to thinking about noise in general.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In real life, the noise is a little bit asymmetric.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So if the qubit levels are defined by energy levels,

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you are more likely to have the phase information randomized

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
than which energy level being randomized.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So that means that z errors, in practice,

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
can be much more common than x errors.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But that's sort of a second order consideration.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So first, if you can fix depolarizing noise,

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
then you're happy.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Then later, you make things more efficient

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and you focus on the fact that some errors

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
are more common than others.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,000


145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There's one more channel which I actually won't even

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
write down the definition of, I just want to mention.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And this will also be discussed on the homework-- is

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the amplitude damping channel.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This one cannot be written as a mixture of unitaries.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it corresponds-- you can think of it as corresponding

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to an atom that's in a superposition of a ground

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
state and an excited state.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And this atom has a property that if it's in the ground

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
state, it just sits there.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's what ground states do.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But if it's in the excited state,

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
then it will fall down to the ground state at some rate,

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and in the process emit a photon.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So this is something that the environment will measure.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It will notice if a photon has been emitted.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And when that happens, you definitely

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
end up in the ground state.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And so this is something that, in the limit, if you apply it

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for long enough, will always push you to the ground state.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But if you run it for a finite amount of time,

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
if you start in the excited state,

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you'll still have some amplitude of remaining in the excited

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
state.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So it does not completely destroy the information.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it's a physically very relevant form of noise.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And to model it, arguably Kraus operators

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
are one of the more natural ways of doing it.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
