00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So density matrices can arise two different ways,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and I've already told you one of them.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Density matrices arise two different ways.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000


5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
One is ensemble of pure states, or actually, I should just

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
say quantum states, because an ensemble of density matrices

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is just their average density matrix.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Two, throw away half a pure state.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000


10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So have psi equals 1 over 2 0, 1 plus 1, 0 psi.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000


12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Throw away first qubit.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000


14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You get density matrix.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000


16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And how do you do that?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000


18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to start out with an example than doing

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the abstract calculations because I think that's clearer,

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
then I'll do the calculations on a general pure state.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000


22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So what you do is a partial trace.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000


24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So density matrix for 1 over 2 0, 1 plus--

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what did I use--

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
0, 1 plus 1, 0 is 0.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000


28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
1, 1, 1, 1, let's put a half in front of it, 0.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000


30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Partial trace on first qubit.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000


32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
OK, so what do we do?

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, what we do is we divide this into--

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
when d by d grid where--

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000


36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to label these.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000


38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So first qubit, that corresponds to throwing away

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the first qubit.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000


41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's trace A. We'll say the first qubit is

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
a and the second is b of that.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So we want to throw away the first qubit,

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so we only care about the second qubit.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:35,000


46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's call this alpha 1, 1, alpha 1, 2,

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
alpha 2, 2, alpha 3, 3.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We're going to take alpha 1, 1 plus alpha 2, 2

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
plus alpha 3, 3.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000


51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And in this case, trace on a of this matrix is equal to--

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
well, we take this guy plus this guy--

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
1/2, 1, 1, 0, 0.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000


55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Trace b gives trace alpha 1, 1, trace alpha 1, 2,

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
trace alpha 1, 3, alpha 2, 1, et cetera.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what we do is we just take the trace of each of these 2

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
by 2 matrices for that one.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000


60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
For this system, we get 1/2, 1, 0, 0, 1.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So maybe this was a bad example because it gives you

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the same thing for the partial trace on the first qubit

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and the partial trace on the second qubit.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000


65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that is how you do the partial trace

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
with actual matrices.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
