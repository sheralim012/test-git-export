1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We just have to talk a little bit

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
about the size of the stabilizer group.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So suppose that s is generated by s1 through sl.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So I've written it in terms of generators like this.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And what this means is that if you have some element in s,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can write it as s1 to the a1, s2 to the al, sl to the al,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where a1 through al are 0 or 1.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In other words, each one of the--

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
there's a product where each generator

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
is either present or absent.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know there's a few nice simplifications I get here

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
relative to a general group.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I know I never need an exponent higher than 1,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because each generator has to either square--

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
OK, before I said they squared to identity.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's not true.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They have to square is either identity or minus identity.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I want to exclude the case where they square the minus

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
identity, because I don't want minus identity in the group.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So the generators, because it's the stabilizer group,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
have to square to identity.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So power of 2 and higher, I've already covered.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Second, I can put them in whatever order

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I like because it's a Boolean.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I don't have to worry about order.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So these are the most general product of these generators

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
looks like this.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, you have to be a little bit careful,

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because it could be that you multiply some of these together

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and different products give you back to same group element.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I want to rule that out.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And something analogous to linear independence,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I say that s1 through sl are independent if this product is

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
equal to identity only when all these a's are 0.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OK.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I can always get identity by putting all the a's equal to 0.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That should be the only way to get identity.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And just like for linear independence,

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
if you have this, then it means that any group element can

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
be obtained in a unique way.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because if I could obtain it in two different ways,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that I could multiply those together.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And that would give me an alternate way

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
of reaching the identity.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So saying I can reach the identity in only one way

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
means I can only reach any group element in a unique way.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000


48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So if I have l independent generators,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
then what that means is that the size of s is 2 to the l, right?

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I just have two choices of each one.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Every choice, every unique choice

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
gives me a distinct group element.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And so what that means is that the dimension

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
of the space I stabilize is 2 to the n minus l.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Finally, this is the proof of the claim I made earlier

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and that we saw with these examples,

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that every independent stabilizer cuts

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
