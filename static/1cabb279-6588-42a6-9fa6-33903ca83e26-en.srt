1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You can ask lots of questions like,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
why can we use density matrices instead of ensembles.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Does it density matrix specify anything ensemble, and things

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
like that.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And the answer to this is a therm.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000


7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You cannot distinguish between two different ensembles

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of states with the same density matrix.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:50,000


10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And I will be using rho as a symbol for density matrices

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because, basically, that's the standard.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, given an ensemble you can compute density matrix rho.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And you can not distinguish between two ensembles

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for the same rho, which means, for any experiment

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
you do on a system, all you need to know the rho

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and you don't need to know the actual ensembles.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So rather than having ensemble, which assigns some probability

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
distribution to every quantum state,

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
it's much easier to work with density matrices

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which, instead of a potential infinite number of parameters,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you only have a finite number of parameters.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If the size of the system is d, the number

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of parameters in the density matrix

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
is just d squared complex numbers.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So first I want to convince you that two different ensembles

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
can have the same density matrix.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So ensemble A, with probability 1/2, you get 1 over root 3, 0

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
plus root 2 over 3, 1 with probability 1/2.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
1 over root 3, 0 minus 2 over 3, 1.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000


31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ensemble B, you get probability 1/3, 0 and probability 2/3, 1

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, rho for A is equal to 1/2.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000


34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll just call that psi plus, plus 1/2 psi minus.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000


36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is psi plus?

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well it equals 1/2.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000


39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OK, so, it's just a matrix and up in this corner

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you get 1 over root 3 times 1 over root 3, which is 1/3.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And here you get 2/3, root 2/3, 2/3, plus one half of 1/3,

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
root 2/3, root 2/3.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And both of these have minus signs

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
because this was 1 over root 3 times minus root 2/3.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And here you have 2/3.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's equal to 1/3, 2/3, 0, 0.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000


48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is this clear so far?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Any questions?

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So row B is equal to 1/3 0, 0.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Plus 2/3, 1, 1 equals 1/3, 1, 0, 0, 0 plus 2/3 0, 0, 0, 1.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000


53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
OK?

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It equals the same thing.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000


56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So here are two different ensembles with the same density

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
matrix.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And you can not distinguish these two.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So rather than doing an example on this,

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to do a whole bunch of abstract calculations that

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
prove that you cannot distinguish these two.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
