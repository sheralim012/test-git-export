1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
The reason I'm mentioning norms is

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
that these are another way of characterizing the state

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
spaces that we're working with.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So l1 corresponds naturally to probability distributions,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because that probability distribution is something

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
whose entries sum to 1.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is, in other words, a unit vector in the l1 norm.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The l2 norm corresponds to pure states.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And for quantum states, there are

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
other norms that describe them, which are norms of matrices.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000


12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So let me define the Schatten p-norm of a matrix M. The

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Schatten is denoted Sp.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000


15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Schatten p-norm is the lp norm of the singular

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
values of M So the Schatten 1 norm

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is the sum of the singular values,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the Schatten 2 norm is the square root

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of the sum of the squares of the singular values, et cetera,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and the S infinity is the maximum singular value.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And something which I do not have time to fully go into

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is the S1 norm corresponds to density matrices.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just like l1 corresponds to probability distributions,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
density matrices have the sum of their eigenvalues add up to 1.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hermitian matrices, eigenvalue, and singular values

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
are the same.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so the density matrices, you can

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
think of as positive operators whose singular values sum to 1.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Whereas measurement operators, if you go back

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to this condition, if you look at a single measurement

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
operator, it should be positive semi-definite,

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and its eigenvalues should be at most 1.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If I have many of them, it has to add up to identity.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So if any one of them has an eigenvalue bigger than 1,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
it's not a valid measurement operator.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So since it's Hermitian and positive semi-definite,

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
again, eigenvalues and singular values are the same.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So the S infinity norm just says it's

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
about the largest eigenvalue, that should be less than

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
or equal to 1.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So density matrices are objects with S1 norm equal to 1.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Measurement operators have S infinity norm bounded by 1.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And so I'm a little bit out of time.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Next time, I may say a little bit more

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
about the geometry of the states.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But this is another geometric way

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
of looking at the different objects of density matrices

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
