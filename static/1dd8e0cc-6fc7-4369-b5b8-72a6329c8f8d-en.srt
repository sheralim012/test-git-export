0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
OK so this can correct X errors, but not Z errors.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One thing we could do, so example 2

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is, any classical code in the plus minus basis.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000


5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So remember, by plus I mean 0 plus 1 over root 2, minus I

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
mean 0 minus 1 over root 2.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000


8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
These are the eigenstates of the x operator.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000


10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And everything I said here goes through

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but with X and Z swapped.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So if I write, and maybe the easiest way

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to think about this is, I can write

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:28,000
C is the span of H tensor n c 1 through H tensor n c 2

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to the k.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Here, H is the Hadamard matrix.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It has the property that H of 0 is plus and H applied to 1

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is minus.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if I have a string of 0's and 1's, it

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
will convert it to a string of pluses and minuses.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000


22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It also is a property that HXH is equal to Z,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and HZH is equal to X, and H is equal to H dagger, which

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is why I'm not bothering to write down daggers here.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So such a code will correct the set of up to d minus 1

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
over 2 Z errors.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000


28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So before we did the Hadamards we corrected

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
X's, we apply Hadamards everywhere,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
turning 1's into pluses and minuses and exchanging X and Z.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So it's not surprising that this way, we correct Zs.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Of course now we have the opposite problem,

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we're no good against X's.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In fact, we make our life harder against X's, just like here we

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
