1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let me just summarize.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Sometimes called generalized measurements,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
as opposed to the von Neumann measure in a basis.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our collection is M1 through Mn, that sum to identity

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
at our positive semi-definite.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I mention these in part because they're

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
are an application of the quantum operation formalism.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But you could also think of them as taking you

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
outside of quantum states.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So if you have a view of the world in which some things are

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
classical, like things we can see and manipulate,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and some things are quantum, and to get out,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you need to get a classical answer out of the lab

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
by making a measurement, then you could ask,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
what is the most general measurement formalism

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we could have?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And this is it, a nice application of the quantum

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
operations formalism.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
[INAUDIBLE]

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So in case you couldn't hear the question,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll paraphrase by saying, what about

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the post-measurement state.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So one feature of measurement you've learned in quantum

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
mechanics is collapse.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Not only do you get an outcome, but the state is modified.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I have, in a sense, given an answer

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to how this state is modified here.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And the answer is that the state is completely destroyed.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The output of this thing is not a residual quantum state

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and a measurement outcome.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The output of this thing is just the classical measurement

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
outcome.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This corresponds to the type of measurement

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that, let's say, a photon detector does.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
After the photon detector figures out

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
if there's a photon there or not, the photon is gone.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you had more questions about its polarization,

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it's too late.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But you could also ask about a non-demolition measurement, one

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that extracts the information, but leaves as much

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of the quantum state behind as possible.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And this actually is a nice consequence of the Kraus

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
operator conditions.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Make sure I'm not fully erasing.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And you can write a non-demolition measurement

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
as follows, as a mixture of these two pictures.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it'll be sum over e Ve rho Ve dagger tensor e.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So this is the residual quantum state,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and this is the measurement outcome.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And if you want to get probabilities into this,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we can write this as follows.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sum over e Ve rho Ve dagger divided by trace Ve rho Ve

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:11,000
dagger tensor trace Ve rho Ve dagger times cat e.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, this is the normalized state.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's leave aside-- some of the probabilities are 0.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's say they don't appear in the sum.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now I'm left with a normalized quantum state,

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and these are now numbers, real numbers.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And in fact, if you look at what these numbers are,

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
trace Ve rho Ve dagger is equal to trace Ve dagger Ve rho.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000


64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And this quantity here, you could call Me

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And you'll see that the Kraus operator condition

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that these sum to identity is the same as the condition

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that these Me sum to the identity.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And so you asked about a more complicated version

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
on measurement in which you consider

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
both the probability of the output and the residual state.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And this is how you do that, how you bridge between the Kraus

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
operators and this more complicated form

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
of measurement.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And so I'll mention one more thing.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So the way you relate them is you

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
say Me is equal to Ve dagger Ve.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is like taking a square root,

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but not necessarily the positive square root.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And so if you know the Kraus operator, there's a unique Me.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But in the reverse direction, it's not unique.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so that's like saying there are

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
many different residual states that you

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
could get that would be compatible

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
with this measurement.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For example, after you get the measurement outcome,

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you could just do some unitary on the state.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Even one that depends on the measurement outcome.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All that is totally legal, and would

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
be of a legal form of quantum collapse.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And so if you're just given this form of measurement,

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
it's not uniquely determined what kind of collapse you get.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And so if you want to talk about that,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
you have to really generalize it in this way.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
