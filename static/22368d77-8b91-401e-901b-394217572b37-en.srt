0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So this is a great simplification,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
because an ensemble has an infinite number

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of degrees of freedom.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A density matrix has only d-- is only d square numbers.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And so if it's qubits, then that's

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
just a two by two matrix.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's much simpler.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000


9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
On the other hand, there's something

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a little bit unsatisfactory about the definition of density

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
matrices that I've given.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So what we would like is we would

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
like a more mathematical definition of density matrices.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000


15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You could say that this definition here

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is a little bit like an operational definition, right?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If I ask you what is a density matrix, you would say,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
well, it's a matrix of this form,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
meaning RHO is the density matrix,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
if there exists an ensemble of quantum states,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with probability px and states si

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
x, such that if I write out this expression, I get RHO.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So that's a perfectly valid way of defining density matrices,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but it's a little bit cumbersome, right?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If I just write down a square full of numbers,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
how can you tell me if that's a density matrix?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You know, how do I know if there's some ensemble that

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
corresponds to that?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's not immediately obvious just

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
from looking at a matrix, whether it's of the right form.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Whereas, if you go back to the other entries of this table,

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
if I give you a vector, you can check is the norm equal to one,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
or a bunch of probabilities.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do they add up to one?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are they nonnegative?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We would like a similarly mathematically easy to check

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
definition of density matrices.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And one-- the usual definition is the following.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We say that RHO is a density matrix

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
if trace RHO is equal to one, and RHO

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is positive semidefinite.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So--

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:30,000


44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this greater than or equal to zero

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
notation, or PSD, means that the matrix

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is positive semidefinite.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And this is something which there--

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So what does positive semidefinite mean?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There are three equivalent definitions of this.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000


52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So PSD means either that the eigenvalues--

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000


54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
sorry, let me--

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
PSD means that RHO is Hermitian.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And there are three more conditions, all of which

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
are equivalent.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you can either ask that the eigenvalues are all

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
created equal to zero.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000


61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can ask that if you take any expectation of RHO,

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
or if you think of it as a quadratic form,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you always get something which is nonnegative.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So x RHO x is greater than zero for all states x.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And there's a third more mathematical definition,

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
which says that RHO 10 factorize as the product of a matrix

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A times it's dagger.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One way to think about these is in terms

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
of getting to think of why these are naturals to think

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
about the case when the dimension is one,

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and you have a one by one matrix.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then this is-- you just have a number, saying that Hermitian

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
means that it's a real number.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then saying that it's positive

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
semidefinite, in each case corresponds

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to the number being nonnegative, right?

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If it's one by one, the matrix is--

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that number is the eigenvalues.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that should be greater than or equal to zero.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This property right here is also equivalent to that

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
being a nonnegative number.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And, finally, this says that the number

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
can be written as a complex number

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
times a complex conjugate which, again, is true if

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and only if the number is not negative.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But, of course, PSD generalizes this to matrices.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So this is a mathematical characterization

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
of density matrices.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Above, I gave an operational one,

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and I claim that those are equivalent.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In other words, if you have a density matrix,

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it can be written in this way.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It satisfies these properties.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Treyf RHO is one.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
RHO is positive semidefinite.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And vice-versa.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If I have a matrix RHO that satisfies these properties,

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
there exists a corresponding ensemble.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000


100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's a nontrivial statement, so

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to prove that takes a little bit of work.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And that's something I'm going to skip right here, because I

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
assume either you've seen it or, if not, that you'll review it.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So if you haven't seen it before,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I just wanted to highlight that it's not obvious

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that that's true.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
However, it is true.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So these are two ways of thinking about this lower right

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
box can be either an ensemble, which has a density matrix,

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
or you can just define density matrices directly

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
without the need for ensemble.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
