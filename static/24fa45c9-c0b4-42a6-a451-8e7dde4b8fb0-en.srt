1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what I've said about quantum codes is very general.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And we have a hard time, even with fully general

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
classical codes--

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we have to retreat to linear codes, classically.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So quantumly, it's not surprising we also

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
want to look at an analog of linear codes.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's-- let me just first review what classical linear codes

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
are.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So a classical linear code we can

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
write as the image of some generator matrix,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or the kernel of some check matrix.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000


13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And either way, it's a linear subspace of F_2 to the n.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
These are two equivalent ways of describing it.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Neither one is fundamental.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Either one would work.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But what we will find is that this, the check operators,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
will generalize nicely to the quantum case.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000


20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This image of the generators is not the most natural thing

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to generalize.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We'll see that some version of the generators

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
appears in the quantum case, but they're not the most useful way

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of defining the code, whereas the kernel of the check matrix.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So let me just briefly explain how

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to think about the kernel of the check matrix

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in a way that could work for quantum codes.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And to do this, let me go back to thinking

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
about classical codes as quantum codes.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And just using the quantum formalism

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to describe these classical codes that we already have.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So in other words, let me take C to be the span of all x

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
where x belongs to the classical code.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000


35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All these x's satisfy H_x equals zero.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Right?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's what it means to be the check matrix.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And we can reduce this to saying any column of H

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or any linear combination of columns has inner product 0.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is for any h in the image of capital H.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is true for the columns.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's also true for any linear combinations

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that they are orthogonal to x in this F_2 sense.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000


45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I want to write it like this.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I can think of a quantum operator that will measure

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
whether this is the case.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And so to do this, let me define z to the h.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You have to be careful about this notation.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That could be a single cubit.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But if h is a vector, what that means is z_1 to the h_1, z_2

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to the h_2, z_n to the h_n.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000


54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So if we apply z_h to the vector x, what are we going to get?

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We're going to get z_1 h_1 x_1 tensor z_n to the h_n x_n.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000


57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Each one in each place, we're going

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to get a phase of minus 1.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If h_1 is equal to 1 and x_1 is equal to 1.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Otherwise, we won't get any phase.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So we put this together, we get minus 1

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to the inner product of h with x, at x.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And here, it's kind of nice because inner product

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
is mod 2, which goes really well with the fact

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that we're doing minus 1 to this number.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And so now, I find that x is in the code if

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and only if it's in the plus 1 eigenspace of all of these z_h.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000


69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so what I've done is I've written the code--

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000


71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the code space is now the set of states psi

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that are plus 1 eigenstates of all

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
of these z to the h operators from all h

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in the image of capital H.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So don't worry too much about what does is this set image

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
of capital H. The relevant thing to think about here is my code

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
space is the simultaneous plus 1 eigenspace of all of these

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
different operators, all of these z to the h's.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And so before, I had this F_2 linear algebra picture.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And what I'm saying is that if you move to polymatrices,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
this is equivalent to being the plus 1

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
