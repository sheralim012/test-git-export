1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
There's one more application I want

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to describe of the symplectic picture, which

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is a way of simulating a quantum circuit

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
on a classical computer.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Normally, you would think that if I have a quantum

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
circuit on n qubits, I just have to write down

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a state of dimension 2 to the n, and that's

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
going to take me time 2 to the n,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and every step is going to take time 2 to the n.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And my memory requirements are also large.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's just really hard, and this is, of course,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the early motivation for building quantum computers.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then you might say, well, there

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
are special classes of computation

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where this is not true.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For example, if I only have single cubic gates,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I just need to write down the state of each qubit.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't have to worry about entanglement,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and that's going to be a much smaller amount of memory

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and time.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But then you might say, well, looks

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
like entanglement is responsible for the power of quantum

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
computing.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Entanglement is what gives us these 2

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to the n dimensional vectors, and that

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is where the hardness of stimulation comes from.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And that intuition, I think, has a large inner product

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with the truth, but it's not quite true.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because the Gottesman-Knill theorem describes a large class

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
of non-trivial computations that you can do,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which can, nevertheless, be totally simulated classically,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and these are the Clifford's circuits.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And technically, to talk about a simulation,

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have to also talk about how you initialize it and measure.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So Gottesman-Knill says, let's say

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I start with the all zero string.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I apply some Clifford unitary.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I measure, let's say, the first qubit in the v basis.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then I repeat.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I go back to this step, and now under my remaining qubits,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I do some other unitary, and then I do another measurement,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and I do what are called even an adaptive computation.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I measure one qubit, but I still have many qubits left

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that are uncollapsed.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can do further Cliffords on those,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and all this I claim can be simulated.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So all this there exists an efficient classical simulation.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
By efficient I mean time that's less than n,

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that's less than some polynomial of n.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So this is interesting for a few reasons.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
First, just conceptually, the Clifford group

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
can make a lot of entanglement.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can do a zero then Hadamard and then control not,

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
then you have a bell pair.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you can get GHC states and many body entangled states.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Pretty complicated states that are definitely very entangled

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
can come out of Clifford circuits.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so this argues, it's not just the entanglement.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000


60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is exactly the secret ingredient

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
behind quantum speed up?

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000


63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's something which I don't think

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we have a short answer to, and definitely Gottesman-Knill

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is part of what makes the question complicated.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So on a conceptual level about the power of quantum

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
computing is interesting.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's also always nice of efficient algorithms.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now, the Clifford circuits are not

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
universal for quantum computing, so we can't use this

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to simulate Shor's algorithm.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We probably would have heard about it by now.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But you can use it to simulate Clifford's circuits

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and those are useful, as we'll see in the next section,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
for fault tolerant quantum computing.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And so if you want to know how does your error correction

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
scheme work in the presence of poly errors,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and your error correction is based on Clifford gates,

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
can simulate that on hundreds of qubits

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
using a classical computer.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so that's pretty useful to be

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
able to go beyond to have something that's

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
more efficient than just full simulation of the wave vector.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
