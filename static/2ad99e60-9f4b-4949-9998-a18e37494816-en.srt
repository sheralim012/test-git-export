00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, I want to move on to talk about quantum operations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In other words, what dynamics are possible in quantum theory?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So this is the state space.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And these are states where we haven't said how they change,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
right?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We got them somehow, maybe we'll measure them.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But we've made no statement about how

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
either our conscious actions are going to change them,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or they will inevitably change in their own internal

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
evolution, or some unwanted noise will affect them.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All of these are things we have to study beyond just

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the basic state spaces.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the set of available operations

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
will depend on what type of theory.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so I want to build up to the operations

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we do on density matrices by reviewing

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the possible operations on these other theories

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in the other three cells of the box.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So again, we can make this grid.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Classical, quantum, deterministic, random.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000


22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, what can we say about the operations

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in these other cells?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So if I have a deterministic theory, has d possible states,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
what are the possible transitions?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000


27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So I haven't told you much, right?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I haven't said anything about physically what they are

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or how we're doing these transitions.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
All I'm saying is that you should

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
start with a deterministic state,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and end with a deterministic state.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to stay within the theory

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of deterministic classical states.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So what can you say about the available transitions?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000


37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How would you describe them mathematically?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's that?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A matrix, right.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
With, what about the matrix?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000


42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You could say it has a matrix of zeros and ones, maybe.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right, because each state should be mapped to one other state.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Another, maybe even simpler way of doing it,

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
is you could say you have functions.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
From the set 1 through d, mapping to the set 1 through d.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And you could represent these functions as a matrix,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
like you said, or you could just say those are my operations.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They are functions that map the set 1 through d

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to the set 1 through d.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tells you almost nothing.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
One important feature of this is that this

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
could destroy information.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So if I have a bit of valid operation,

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can do to it is ignore the input and output zero.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Right, so the erase operation Is a valid operation

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can do to bits.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What about deterministic quantum states?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So if I have a state, psi, what are

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the physically possible ways that this can evolve in time?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000


62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
From the Schrodinger equation, what kinds of time evolution

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
are possible?

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Unitary matrices, right.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So the operations here, we can write is as U of d.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Meaning d by d, unitary matrices.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mathematically, these are the operations

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that are linear on psi, and preserve the length.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So psi is a unit vector.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
After some time evolution, it had better

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
remain a unit vector.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so, the linear operations, If you're a linear operation,

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
then you can be described as a matrix.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And if you preserve the length, then that

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
means you should be a unitary matrix.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And so, the linearity here, by the way,

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
is we've already used it a few times.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So we're using it to get unitarity.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was also implicit in our description

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
of density matrices.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So I said for density matrices that observables only

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
depend linearly on this combination of ket-psi bra-psi.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And if you want to do something crazy,

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
like go to a nonlinear quantum mechanics,

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you would have to abandon that.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And so this is kind of deeply embedded

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
into all of our assumptions that quantum mechanics is linear.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah?

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Your [INAUDIBLE].

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000


91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
By nature.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But, the classical bits, we don't have the evolution

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
equation for that, right?

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
[INAUDIBLE]

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000


96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, right.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So the question is, the Schrodinger equation comes

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
from nature, where does this function f come from?

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The way I would say is the Schrodinger equation comes

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
from nature, and then when we integrate it,

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we obtain some unitary.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In classical mechanics, I'm skipping over

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the microscopic derivation of how things evolve.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can imagine some Newtonian mechanics, or whatever

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
your favorite classical theory is, and then you integrate that

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and you'll get some kind of effective dynamics.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then you could abstract that in this way.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So, you could think of this is an abstraction

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
of Newtonian dynamics that says the particles have

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
some initial position of momenta.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There is some deterministic way that they

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
evolve to some later position and momenta.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And you could imagine, maybe Newtonian mechanics

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
doesn't destroy information, you could

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
imagine modifications of it that destroy information as well.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like sometimes particles get lost.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000


118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Other way to think about this is emerging from a computer.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So if I wanted to describe what a classical computer does,

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it looks like this type of operation.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And that's maybe a more realistic way

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of thinking about it.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then you can ask about what are Maxwell's laws

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that underlie the function of a classical computer.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But if you just want to abstract away from those

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and talk about the information carrying properties,

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
