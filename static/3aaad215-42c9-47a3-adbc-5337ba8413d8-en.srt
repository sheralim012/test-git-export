0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Finally, we can begin talking about this last corner

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of quantum operations.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000


4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And in 8.370, Peter Shor introduced one notion

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of quantum operations, which is, I think,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a very tempting generalization, which is to say you do some

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
unitary but with some probability distributions over

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
unitaries.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's talk now briefly about quantum operations.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000


11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Maybe I should say intro to quantum operations,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
because we'll talk in much more detail

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
next lecture about these.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So one possibility, one case, are called random unitaries.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000


16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So the way that if we have a state psi,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we have a unitary acting on it, it goes to U times ket psi.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For a density matrix, the ket psi part gets multiplied by U,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and the bra psi gets multiplied by U dagger on the right.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000


21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the way a density matrix evolves under time evolution

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is it goes to U rho U dagger.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But this U, and now here's an advantage

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of using density matrices instead of pure quantum states,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
this U can itself be random.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So let's say our particle is going through a magnetic field,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and we don't know exactly what that field is.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Different fields will lead to different time evolutions.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When you average over our uncertainty,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you get a distribution over the final states.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if we have an ensemble where U sub i occurs with probability

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,000
p sub i, then rho will be mapped to this final state.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So with some probability we get Ui rho Ui dagger,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and then we average over all those probabilities.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000


36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a special case of quantum operations.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
These are called random unitary operations.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000


39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it seems like a common generalization

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of these two boxes, right?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Here, we do unitaries.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We can further add random unitaries.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000


44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
However, this does not fully express everything

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that we can do with quantum states.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And so we'll talk a little bit more about that next time.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:24,000


48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, are there any questions about random unitary

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
before I do?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000


51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So some other quantum operations that don't necessarily

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
fit into this framework are, we can take our quantum state

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and add another system.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we can take rho and map it to rho tensor sigma.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I have an atom in my ion trap, let's say.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I bring in another one, right?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And now I consider the joint state.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is, in a sense, only a mathematical operation.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe the other system already existed.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm just expanding the scope of what

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think about to include it.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Still, it's a valid mathematical operation,

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and it's one that we do all the time in real systems.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We bring in maybe a fresh qubit and we

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
interact with our system, so our formalism should include this.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We might also throw away a subsystem.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So if we have a system rho AB, we

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:48,000
might trace out the second part and be left with a state rho A.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Or if we have, let's say, an atom

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that's in a superposition of ground and excited.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
After some time, it decays into the ground state.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That corresponds to just forgetting

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
what your original state was and reinitializing it

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
with some known state.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So we could just have rho that let's say always

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
goes to the state 0.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000


78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All of these are other valid quantum operations

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that don't look like this random unitary picture.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And so in the next lecture, we will

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
come to terms with these types of operations

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and give a generalized framework.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And just to frame what we're going to do,

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
we can think about this.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For density matrices, we have this way

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
of thinking about it that was either operational or

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
mathematical.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The kind of operational one was an ensemble of quantum states,

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
each with some probability.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That was nice to think about conceptually,

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but, mathematically, the trace rho 1

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
equals 1 rho positive semidefinite was nicer.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
For quantum operations, we'll see something similar.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's an operational way of thinking

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
about it, which is natural.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Which is maybe you would join some system,

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you evolve according to the Schrodinger evolution,

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and you throw away some system.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then we'll also see a crisper, more mathematical way

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
