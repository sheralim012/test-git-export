00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
On the other hand, we can talk about measurements,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and to keep things simple, let me just

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
talk about a two outcome measurement.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So there are two outcomes, m and i minus m.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Remember that measurement of a set of matrices

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
have to add up to the identity.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Also, each of these matrices has to be positive semidefinite

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so we need to have m greater than or equal to zero,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and i minus m greater than or equal to zero.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This second condition, of course,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is the same as saying that m is less than

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or equal to the identity matrix.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we can put these together as saying

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that m is in between zero and the identity

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
in the positive semidefinite ordering.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And if m is a positive semidefinite matrix,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
again, the singular values are the eigenvalues.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So the biggest singular value is just the biggest eigenvalue.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And so saying that m is less or equal to identity,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that says all the eigenvalues are at most one.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's the same in this setting as saying that the Schatten

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
infinity norm is at most one.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000


24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So now the set of allowable measurement operators

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
has a description that looks kind of like the density

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
matrices, except here we use s infinity instead of s one.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Also this is less than or equal to one instead of equal to one.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So instead of the unit sphere, we

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
call this the unit ball of s infinity.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000


31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know, it's like the filled in sphere.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000


33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And, so there is a probabilistic analog as well,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
which is that for every event you

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
could assign it a value anywhere between minus one and one.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And this corresponds to sort of a decision rule.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you're given a sample from something,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if you want to decide yes or no about some consequence of it.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So OK, so why is it that measurements

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are described by this one norm and states

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
are described by another one?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This fact that you have one norm for one type of object

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
or another norm for another type of object,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and furthermore that these objects naturally will

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
combine with each other, right?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So we often will write trace of m times row.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right, this is the probability of observing outcome m given

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
density matrix row.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So these things are often essentially innerproducted

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
with each other.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In fact, we can even write this as a sort of inner product

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
on matrices.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So we have these two things that are naturally

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
innerproducted with each other.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But one of them gets measured with one norm,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
another with another norm.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And this phenomenon occurs in a much more general sense

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
under the name of duality.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000


60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
let me define very generally what it means to have,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
given a norm, to have a dual norm.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So given some norm, I'll just write

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
by these double absolute value signs,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we can define what's called a dual norm.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000


66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In the following sense, the dual norm

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
will be denoted by norms of star.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And what the dual norm is, for that vector x,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it's the largest inner product you can have with something

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in the unit ball of this norm.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is the maximum over y less than

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
or equal to one of the inner product of x with y.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Absolute value.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OK?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So here's how to think about it.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This norm is a way of measuring the length of a vector.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It gives me a way of measuring the length of another vector

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to say what is the largest inner product I can

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
have with something that has length one with respect

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to this norm?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So you've seen this before from the L2 norm.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you know if I have a vector, one of the biggest

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
inner products it can have within any unit

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
vector in the usual Euclidean sense, and that inner product,

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that number is just the length of the vector in the Euclidean

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
sense.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So in other words, the L2 norm is dual to the L2 norm.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So L2 is self-dual.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Its dual is itself.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
On the other hand.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
L1 and L infinity are dual.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So if I, let's say this original norm is L infinity.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I say, so the unit ball of l infinity

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
are things where every entry is between minus one and one.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I say, given a vector x, if I want an inner product it

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
with something where every entry is between minus one and one,

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
how big can I make that inner product?

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What I can do is I can just set y

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to be the sign, each entry of y to be

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the sign of the corresponding entry of x.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So this inner product becomes the sum of the entries of x.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In other words, it becomes the one norm of x.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I started with the infinity norm, I took the dual,

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and I got the one norm.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you go in the other direction,

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
take the one norm, the dual of that

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
will be the L infinity norm.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And there is a formula in general,

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
every LP norm is dual to some LQ norm.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's a formula for it which I won't get into,

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but this is more generally LP norms are dual to LQ norms

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
for some other Q. Two is special, that's

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the only one that is self-dual.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So the reason I mention this, is the same

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is true for the Schatten norms.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So S1 and S infinity are also dual.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In general if LP and LQ are dual,

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
then SP and SQ are also dual.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And this is something that is actually

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
an optional problem on your problem set,

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to help you understand a little more the geometry of a set

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of states and density matrices.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a little bit harder to visualize,

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but I often go back to this picture of L1 and L

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
infinity when I think about what these things look like.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
S1 and S infinity, the geometry is like the matrix version

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
