00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Mathematically, a norm is a way of measuring

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the length of something, and it should have the property

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that it's homogeneous.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So if C is a complex number, and I multiply my vector

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by that number, it should scale the norm of the vector

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
appropriately.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000


8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It should satisfy the triangle inequality.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000


10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's called the triangle inequality.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And a further property of norms is

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that it should be separating.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Something should have norm 0 if and only

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
if the vector is itself 0.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And so that means we can use it as a distance.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We can say the distance between two vectors

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is the norm of one vector minus the other one,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then two vectors have distance 0

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
only if they are indeed the exact same vector.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000


21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So the usual norm for vectors that we have

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is the Euclidean norm.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000


24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You take all the entries' absolute value,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
square them, add them up, and then square root that sum.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this can be generalized a little bit.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let's say that V is a d dimensional vector.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000


29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There's something called the lp norm of V, which says

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
do what you did for Euclidean.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But instead of two, just use some other number.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's say p.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So this is sum over i absolute value of Vi to the p-th power,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and take the 1 over p-th root of the whole thing.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000


36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You need that 1 over p-th root so that it's homogeneous,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and in some cases for the triangle inequality.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So these are also norms.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So l2 is the Euclidean norm.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000


41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But the other ones are also natural.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
l1 is just this sum of the entries of the vector.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sometimes, it's called the Manhattan distance,

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
because if you're walking on a grid,

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and you have to go over three blocks and up two blocks,

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you have to walk five blocks.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can't just go on hypotenuse.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000


49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And in general, as you increase p,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
this becomes more biased towards the larger entries.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So in the extreme, the l infinity norm

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
is just the maximum entry of Vi.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
