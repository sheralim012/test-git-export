00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Measurement-- so we're just talking

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
about projective measurements here,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is a subclass of all measurements.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we're never going to tell you what all measurements look

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
like in this course.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But maybe we'll give you a homework problem

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with an example of a more general measurement.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So measurement-- you have pi 1 through pi sub

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
k, our projection matrices.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000


11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Probability of outcome j is pi sub pi j

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
on our quantum state, which we'll call psi sub i squared.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000


14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So now, suppose we have a probabilistic ensemble

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for quantum states.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have quantum state psi sub i with probability p sub i.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000


18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On ensemble, the probability of outcome j is just sum over i

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
equals 1 to however many quantum states we had.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll just call that sum over i.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Pi sub j, psi sub i squared--

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
except we really have to multiply by the probability

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
of each outcome state.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So this comes from the formula.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The probability of outcome j is a probability

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
you had the i-th quantum state in the ensemble

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
times the probability you got, j,

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
given that you had the i-th quantum state in the ensemble.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this equals probability of i-th state times probability

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
of j-th outcome given i-th state.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000


32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's start working with this.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is just p sub i, pi sub j, psi sub i, psi sub i,

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
pi sub j because the absolute value

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of a complex number squared is the complex number

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
times its conjugate.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And because everything is linear,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we can move the sum inside because--

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
well, basically because pi sub j is independent of i.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So that is equal to pi sub j, sum over i

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:31,000
p sub i, psi sub i, psi sub i, pi sub j

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
equals pi sub j rho pi sub j.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000


44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah?

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So this is still a matrix, right?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000


47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And we're supposed to get a probability out of this?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We are.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So let's go back up here.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Pi sub i trace equals--

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000


54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is pi-- does pi have a dagger on the right?

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Pi is a projection matrix, so pi dagger is pi.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So, yeah, this pi should really have a pi dagger.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But pi equals pi dagger, so, yeah.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So this is equal to--

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000


60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I need to put the trace in--

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000


62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:59,000
trace of pi j and equals trace of pi j rho pi j

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
equals trace of pi j squared rho equals trace of pi j rho.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000


65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I guess this is equal to this by the cyclic property

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
of trace.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where does the base come from?

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000


70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, it comes from pi j, psi squared is equal to psi i

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
pi j psi i.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000


73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And this should be an absolute value.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000


75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Maybe I'll put a squared on here,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
although pi is a projection matrix.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Pi squared equals pi is equal to trace of psi i pi j psi sub i

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
because the trace of a scalar is just the scalar.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And now the cyclic property of trace

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
says you can move this around.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And we get trace of pi j, psi i, psi i because the trace of ABC

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is equal to trace of BCA.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000


84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the right way to do this and for density matrices, trace

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is really the right way to do this.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000


87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
OK, so this says that the probability

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
of seeing an outcome just depends on the density matrix

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and not which ensemble.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
