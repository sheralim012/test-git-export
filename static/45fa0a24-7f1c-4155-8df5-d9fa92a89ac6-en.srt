0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before I go on, I want to justify this claim

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that every stabilizer cuts down the dimension by a half.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And to do that, we will calculate the projector

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
onto a code subspace.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So let me talk about stabilizer--

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
subspace-- projectors.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So-- let me define pi sub s--

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000


9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to be the projector onto to V sub s.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000


11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Should I explain what I mean by a projector onto a subspace?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It just means a linear operator that maps everything

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
into the subspace.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And then if you're already in the subspace,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
it acts trivially.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So you can think of it as Hermitian operator

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's plus 1 eigenspace corresponding to this subspace.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And everything else is a 0 eigenspace, OK?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we want to know how to calculate this object.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And-- I claim there's a nice formula for it--

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000


22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which is given by taking your stabilizer subgroup

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and just averaging over it.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So this is the number of elements in the stabilizer

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
subgroup.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You divide by that.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And then you sum over all the elements--

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
just put that matrix there.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000


30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So if I average over the stabililzer subgroup,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I claim this gives me a projector onto the code

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
subspace.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And this fact, by the way, is sort of a general math fact.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This does not rely on any properties of the polys.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It just relies on that top definition up there a,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Vs. And on the fact that s is a group.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So-- let me sketch the proof of this.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the first thing I want to observe is that if g is in s--

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000


40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then g times pi s is equal to pi s.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OK, so why is this true?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, if you look at g pi s, I can think of this as sum

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
over the elements of the group--

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
g times h.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000


46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Will let me divide--

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
let me put the normalization factor over here--

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000


49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
so I don't have to keep writing it.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I get sum over the elements of the group, g times h.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And now-- the key thing about a group

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is that because it's closed under multiplication

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and has inverses, it's got some list of elements.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And if I take each one of those elements

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and multiply it by an element of the group,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it sends each element to a different element in the group.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe the same but some other element.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000


59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And this mapping must be one to one

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This multiplication will never send

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
two elements to the same one.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because if it did, things would not be invertible.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If it did, I couldn't invert left multiplication

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
if this left multiplication was destroying information

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
by sending two elements to the same one.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So when I take the list of elements in s

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and multiply each one on the left by g,

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have to just get back the elements of s

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in some other order.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So this must be sum over h prime in s.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you can call h prime, gh, if you like of h prime.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How do I know the pi system?

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000


75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, yes, you're absolutely right.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000


77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let me do this.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000


79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me define pi s to be this sum right here.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then I claim it's equal to the projector.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, right, so the objection is I defined

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
pi s to be the projector onto the subspace.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I claimed it had this form.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000


85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Of, course, in the end, we'll see that they're all equal.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But the way I want to do the proof is in the other order.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to start by defining pi s to be

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
this average over the elements of the stabilizer

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
through just some mathematical object.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have no idea if it's a projector yet.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I will prove to you that it is in fact the desired

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
projector.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
OK?

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So pi s is this object.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000


96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And it has the property that if I multiply on the left by g--

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000


98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I get back this object.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OK?

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because now I have this sum over h prime

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which is just the reordering of the elements in s.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So that proves this fact that if I

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
multiply pi s on the left by g, I get back pi s.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now you're absolutely right.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We have no idea what pi s is.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Other than the sum, we just know one property of it.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:58,000


108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So what do we do with this fact?

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So what that implies--

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
is-- if g is in s--

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000


112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
G dagger is in s.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so G dagger pi s is also equal to pi s--

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
right.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
G is closed under inverses.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
These elements are all unitary.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And so in particular, if I have one G dagger

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and multiply on the left by pi s.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I average over a bunch of them, the same thing is true.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So in particular, pi s dagger times pi s is equal to pi s.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I've just replaced the G dagger here

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
with an average over all of the G daggers.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In other words, with pi s dagger.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000


125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000


127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Now this last equation tells us that pi s is a projector.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So why is that?

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, if you're of this form, you must be Hermitian.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In fact, you must be positive semidefinite.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In fact, all of your eigenvalues should have the property

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that when you square them, you get back the same eigenvalue.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now what numbers squared equal themselves?

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The only options are 0 and 1.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So from this equation, you know that all

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of the eigenvalues of pi s are 0 and 1 and that it's Hermitian.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So that means it's a projector onto something.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The only debate now is what does it project onto?

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Does it, in fact, project onto V sub s?

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
OK?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So therefore, the eigenvalues of pi s are all 0, 1.

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000


143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So the only question is what does this project onto?

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So let's suppose you have pi s times some arbitrary state, Cy.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And we multiply by g for sum.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So g is in s.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000


148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cy Is arbitrary.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What can we say about this equation--

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
about this expression?

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What does that equal to?

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000


153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah?

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're pointing--

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
[INAUDIBLE]

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000


157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Right, you're saying it satisfies the stabilizer

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
equation.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's unaffected by g.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So we know that g times pi s is equal to pi s.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So this is equal to pi s Cy.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So if you put parentheses here, this vector is stabilized by g.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So therefore, pi s Cy is in Vs. In other words, the image of pi

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:29,000
s is contained in Vs On the other hand,

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
if Cy already belongs to Vs, then

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
all of the g's act trivially.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So then-- when we apply pi s to it,

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
all these g's just act like identity.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so we get back Cy.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So this means that Vs is contained in the image of pi s.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So finally, we have that pi s projects onto a projector.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And its image is exactly equal to the space that we want.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, therefore, pi s is equal to the projector

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
onto Vs. Any questions about this argument?

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000


176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can you explain why is dagger into the s?

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why G dagger's an s?

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
S is a group, so it contains its inverses.

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And the elements of s are all unitary.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So their inverses are just given by their daggers.

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
[INAUDIBLE]

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000


184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's right.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, nothing in my argument used the fact

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
that s was a polygroup.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is a totally general fact about groups.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why is g [INAUDIBLE]

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OK, so I guess I don't want to address the general group

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
situation.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There's one thing I'm sort of conflating which

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is the elements of a group with some unitary representation

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
of them.

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, really, what I should say is this works

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
for any subgroup of unitaries.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000


197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Any other questions?

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000


200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
OK, so why did we do this?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I mean, it's nice to have a deal with a calculate projector.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Here's one immediate thing we get from this.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So-- let's try to calculate the dimension of the stabilizer

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
subspace.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000


206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you look at that definition up there,

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
it looks pretty complicated, right.

208
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It depends on the intersection of all these

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
plus 1 eigenspaces.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Who knows how they intersect.

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It was what I said before.

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Do they always have to cut each other in half or not?

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But now that I have a formula for the projector,

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can just say, this is equal to the trace of the projector.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Because the trace if it's 0's and 1's, this will just count

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the number of 1's-- the number of dimensions.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And trace is linear, so this is just average over s--

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
sum over g and s--

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
trace g.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000


221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So-- now-- this seems a little tough

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
because s is a general group.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But what can I say about the trace of a polymatrix?

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000


225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's 0-- mostly 0.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When is it not 0?

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The identity.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So the only time it's non 0 is if it's the identity.

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So if this giant sum--

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
but we don't care about most of it.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We only care about a single term which

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is the identity, which has trace 2 to the n.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So this whole thing--

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000


235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
is 2 to the n over the size of the stabilizer group.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
