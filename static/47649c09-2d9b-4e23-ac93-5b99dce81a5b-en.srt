1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The term stabilizer is used in quantum information

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in sometimes a slightly misleading way.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And let me-- I'll show you how that is in a minute.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's often used to mean two things,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but the first is, it's often used to mean

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a subgroup of the poly group.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let me begin by defining.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000


9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
P sub n will be the real-valued Paulis on n qubits.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So what do I mean by that?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What I mean is, plus or minus identity, X, iY, and Z,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then the n-fold tensor power of this.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I have n qubits.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can have, on each qubit, either identity, X, iY, or Z.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I can also have an overall phase of plus or minus.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm putting the iY here because I want to deal only

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
with real-valued matrices.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you can check that this is a closed group, right?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I multiply X times Z, I get iY.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If I multiply x times iY, I get minus

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Z. So I never-- if I multiply two real-valued Pauli matrices,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I get something else which is real.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000


24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And this avoids me having to deal with imaginary numbers.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Which is not really a big deal-- all of this stuff could go

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
through with imaginaries--

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
it's just slightly simpler to not use them.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So this is a group, meaning it's closed under multiplication

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and contains inverses.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In fact, every element of this group is its own inverse.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it's, of course, not a commuting group-- you know,

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the Paulis do not commute with each other.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what a stabilizer--

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000


35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so we'll talk about many stabilizer-related things.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A stabilizer subgroup is a subgroup of the Pauli matrices

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
with various properties.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
