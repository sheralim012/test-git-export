00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's a final way I want to talk about quantum operations,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is what you could call the axiomatic approach, which is

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to say, let's not think about--

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we started off by saying, physically, we

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
have to shorten our equation and then some

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
changes in bookkeeping.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Another way of doing this is to say,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
here's what a quantum state is.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A quantum operation is something that better preserve that,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and let's just see if we allow everything

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that preserves quantum states.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That is, in a sense, the most generous possible version

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of quantum operations.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So instead of just starting with a few things we can think of

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and composing them, this tries to be exhaustive to say,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
let's make sure we cover every possible thing we

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
can do to density matrices that will leave them

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
density matrices.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If we do this, we can be confident we have not

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
overlooked a possible quantum operation.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So to do this, we'll start by asking, what properties should

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a quantum operation have?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000


24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So the first one--

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I guess I'll say, properties of a quantum operation N.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the first one is that N should

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
be a linear, hermiticity-preserving map.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000


29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hermiticity-preserving is, maybe, uncontroversial.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I put in a Hermitian density matrix,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the output had better be Hermitian.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Otherwise, nothing makes any sense.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Linear is something a little more basic,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and it comes back to quantum mechanics

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
being a linear theory.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But it also-- it's something that we already accepted when

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we defined density matrices.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Remember, when we defined density matrices,

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I said, all observables are linear functions

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
of ket psi, bra psi, so we don't need to write down

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
every property of an ensemble.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can completely, and without loss of generality,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
describe an ensemble in terms of it's density matrix.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And so everything we assumed from that definition--

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
everything we can measure-- is a linear function

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of the density matrix.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And so that's why, if you mixed two states--

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you take one state with probability 1/3,

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the other state with probability 2/3--

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you just do the same operation with the density matrix.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You take 1/3 times one density matrix plus 2/3 times

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the other density matrix.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Linear operations respect this.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They say, if I drop the chalk with probability 1/3,

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and I don't drop it with probability 2/3,

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and I talk about the consequences--

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
those consequences also have probability 1/3, 2/3.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you could do something nonlinear,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then you could, say, after having observed

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that I had dropped the chalk, you

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
could figure out what the underlying probability was

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of me doing it or not.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You could get a lot of really bizarre paradoxes.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So it's possible to get rid of the linear assumption,

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but to do this you'd have to really go back quite far

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and tear up a lot of what we've already accepted.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So for now, even though it's not 100% necessary,

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think we will stick with the linear assumption

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
because to do so otherwise would change

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
a lot of quantum mechanics.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So these are some basic ones.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Another one is that the operation

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
should be trace-preserving, which we'll abbreviate as TP.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So, in other words, trace of N of rho

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is equal to trace of rho.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000


77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Again, this should be a fairly uncontroversial assumption.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The final one is a little bit subtle.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So density matrices have trace 1,

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and they're positive semidefinite.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So the output should also be positive semidefinite.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So you might think that the requirement on this channel

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is something called positivity, which

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is that if rho is positive semidefinite, then N of rho

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is also positive semidefinite.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And it turns out, this is sufficient--

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry-- this is necessary, but not quite sufficient.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We need a little bit more than this.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We need to consider also the possibility

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that our channel acts on part of an entangled system.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And it turns out--

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
so this is called complete positively, or C(P),

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and the statement is that if rho is PSD,

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
then N tends to the identity superoperator--

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000


96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is also PSG.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So if you're completely positive,

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you're definitely positive.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And it turns out, there are maps which are positive but not

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
completely positive.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And so those are things which would not

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
be valid quantum channels.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000


104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So an example of positive but not CP is the transpose map.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So if I take a matrix, and I take its transpose,

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that's a linear operation.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If I started off Hermitian, I will remain Hermitian.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And it turns out, if I started out positive semidefinite,

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll remain positive semidefinite.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But if I apply this to half of the naturally entangled state,

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I will get something that has some negative eigenvalues.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so this is not valid quantum operation

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
because any physical operation we do

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
should make sense even if we apply it

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to only part of the system.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000


117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So if you put these together, you

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
get what are called TPCP maps.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Property one is taken for granted, and, then,

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
given that, we have trace-preserving completely

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
positive is TPCP.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000


123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Try to be as general as possible.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If we satisfy these axioms, we really

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
