00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Peter Shor came out with his algorithm for factoring numbers

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the whole community was really floored and surprised

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by this discovery, but immediately reacted

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
by saying it's a beautiful theoretical discovery that

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
will never be practical and never

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
be implemented because quantum systems are

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so susceptible to noise.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There are three things that were pointed out about this.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So if I start summarizing quantum coding, as of 1995,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
quantum coding-- the analog of quantum to classical codes--

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
were considered impossible because of three major reasons.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First, states collapse when measured.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000


14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Remember a0 plus b1, when measured,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
just give you 0 and 1 with some probabilities.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So you lose that information about a

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and b for a single instance of it.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And you only have a and b when you have an ensemble.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You don't actually get a and b from a single instance

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of a message, in contrast to what you might

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
get from a classical system.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So this also means that you can't just

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
measure by seeing what message you got

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then doing a majority vote on it.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So if I'm doing a classical code, I might say,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
if I'm doing a classicals code, I might say,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
if I'm doing a classical code, I might say something three times

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to make sure that you understand it.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll say it three times so that you

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
make sure you understand it.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll say it two times to make sure that you understand it.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course, you can do a majority vote

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and figure out what I actually meant,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
even though I screw up once.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But that's because you listened to and deciphered the message.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If I'm doing it quantum mechanically, I cannot do that.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So people said that's one reason why

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
there's going to be no such thing as quantum error

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
correction codes.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can't build a quantum repetition code.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The second thing is that we have this model

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for errors over here, the binary symmetric channel.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you either have an error or you did not have an error.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But in the quantum realm, errors aren't so nice to you.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Errors are continuous.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000


47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
For example, rotations-- a qubit could

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
move just an infinitesimal amount on the block sphere.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is that an error or not an error,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
if you just rotated by an epsilon amount?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's very different from this binary symmetric channel.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So it is also well known that analog signals don't really

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
have error correction.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You have to move into the world of digital signal

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
processing and digital signals to get

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
this kind of correction code.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So a great analogy was made between analog computation

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and quantum computation saying that, just

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
as analog computation is unstable,

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
quantum computers will also be unstable,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and therefore, quantum algorithms like Shor's

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
algorithm will be impractical.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The third objection was the fact that, even

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if you did want to build a quantum repetition code,

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
there's something that prohibits this.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Remember we went into this very early on in the class

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
right away, and that is the no cloning theorem.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000


69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Quantum states, if they are unknown, cannot be copied.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000


71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So three major constraints, three major objections

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to the existence of quantum error correction,

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
even in principle--

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and one of the neat things is that Peter Shor did not

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
mention these three objections because it

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
was so obvious to him, perhaps, how to overcome them.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But for the rest of us in the community

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
for whom it wasn't so obvious, it

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
was remarkable to see how they were overcome.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And in fact, a little bit of history

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
is that they were overcome by Peter Shor.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So Peter Shor wrote a second paper after his factoring paper

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
showing how quantum error correction could be done.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
By the way, just in terms of the history,

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
after error correction, the next objection

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that people came up with was that there's

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
no way to make it resilient against failures in gates.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So this is resiliency against errors

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in states and in communication, but not about resiliency

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in, like, if the unitary operator is slightly wrong

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and rotates slightly more or slightly less

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
or around the wrong axis.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That is a concept known as fault tolerance.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So even though error correction was

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
shown to be possible by Peter Shor in a manner

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that I'll review more about in just a moment,

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the next piece of the story, the next missing piece of this,

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
was fault tolerance.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So Peter Shor went and wrote a third paper

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
showing how one could present and construct

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
fault-tolerant quantum computation.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And it took the rest of the better

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
of part of maybe a decade to unravel all of those results

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and understand them.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And so it is because of those three incredible pieces of work

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that Peter Shor is known as such a master of the field today.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I'm only going to show you part of it.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And the thing I want to show you now

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is how these three objections are overcome.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The first of these objections is overcome

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
by realizing that you don't need to measure the state.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So instead of measuring the state, what we will do

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is to employ two strategies.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000


115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The first is never to measure the state,

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and only measure the environment and its effect--

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000


118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that is, the error.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000


120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
All you want to do is find out what the error was.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You don't necessarily care what state was encoded,

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and in fact you don't want to figure that out.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because then you would lose the quantum information

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that you're trying to protect.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But the whole concept of measuring

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the effect of the environment separate

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
from measuring the state that's encoded was a novel one.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So this fixes objection number one.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The second idea, which now we use routinely in quantum error

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
correction but was not conceptualized yet

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
at the time of Peter Shor's first article

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
about error correction, is two orthogonalize errors.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:51,000


134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Such that if you have a small rotation, you can either think

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
of it as being a complete flip or no flip at all.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And you're able to do this if you employ entanglement.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000


138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I'm not going to describe the formalism behind this

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to you, but I will try to post on the class site

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
a beautiful paper by John Preskill titled

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
"How to Fight Entanglement with Entanglement."

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You fight the entanglement caused

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
by the environment that's making errors on the quantum state

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
with a different kind of entanglement, which

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
is the entanglement that exists within the codewords

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and inside the code space.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So it's a beautiful concept, and I

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
hope you'll be able to see where it arises as I go forward.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
