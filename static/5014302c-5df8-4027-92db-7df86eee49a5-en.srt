0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, if I have rho of this form, the eigenvalues of rho

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
are just the vector of probabilities.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So when I demand that rho is positive semidefinite,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what does that say about P1 through Pd?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000


6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What does that condition, that rho is positive semidefinite,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
what does it imply about the P's?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
[INAUDIBLE]

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Right.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It implies, so rho positive semidefinite implies, in fact,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is equivalent to each Px being greater or equal to 0.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You mentioned another thing, which

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is that they add up to 1, which is a property of probability

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
distributions.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But we need more than the fact that rho

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is positive semidefinite to give that.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With trace 1.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We need there's trace 1.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Exactly.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So the trace of rho is just the sum of the diagonal entries.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000


23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And of course, that should equal 1.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And this equation is a two-way street.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We could have started with the fact

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that this is a probability distribution.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then we know that's normalized,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so we derive that this is trace of rho is 1,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and thereby it's a valid density matrix.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We could have gone in the other direction, as well.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We could have said, suppose rho is a matrix of this form

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and I claim that the entries correspond

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to a valid probability distribution.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And that's because the trace of rho is 1.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I know that these entries add up to 1.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And because of this previous fact,

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I knew that they were non-negative.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so this is how probability distributions can

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
embed into density matrices.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000


41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, one important aside is that this is for diagonal density

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
matrices rho.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the eigenvalues of rho are always

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
probability distributions.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So why is that?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Essentially, it's the same argument.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If a matrix-- since rho is positive semidefinite,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
its eigenvalues are always non-negative.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that's one of the conditions to be a probability

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
distribution.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The entries are non-negative.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They also always add up to 1.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And this is because the trace is independent of basis.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So if the eigenvalues of rho are lambda 1 through lambda d,

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
then trace rho is the sum of these eigenvalues.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
One way of seeing this is that we can always

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
choose to take the trace in the eigenbasis of rho.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this was a fact about diagonal rho.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But if we diagonalize it, then you know, in the right basis,

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
everything looks diagonal.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then for any density matrix, the trace

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And so the eigenvalues are always

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
non-negative and sum to 1.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So they always form a probability distribution.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so, in a sense, that shouldn't be surprising.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All we had to do in order to get here

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is choose some fixed orthonormal basis

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and call that the canonical basis.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But we always could have chosen the eigenbasis of rho

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and called it classical in that basis.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All we did, really, was--

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I said fix a basis.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You could also say, get rid of superposition.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But superposition is sort of a mathematical construct, right?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
States are just some vectors.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What we call superposition means we're

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
taking linear combinations of some chosen set of vectors.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So if we just choose our vectors in the first place

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to the eigenbasis of rho, then at least for that state,

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we've defined away superposition.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course, once you have multiple states or time

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
evolution, you can't ignore superposition forever.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But if you're looking at any one state,

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
you can always choose to look at it in its eigenbasis.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And in that basis, it looks essentially classical.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Even a pure state, if you look at it in the right basis,

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
just looks like a deterministic probability distribution.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, there's some basis of perfectly distinguishable

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
states, and we have one of them.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's sort of not very interesting,

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
