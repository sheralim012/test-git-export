00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So next, I want to tell you about what

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
happens to the dephasing channel when you

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
look at it in the Bloch sphere.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's go back and draw the Bloch sphere.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So the Bloch sphere looked like 0, 1, plus minus--

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000


7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:42,000
well, when you multiply the off-diagonal elements by q,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you get 1, 1, 1, 1, that's 1/2, goes to 1/2 1, 1 minus q,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
1 minus q, 1.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And with that, you're just moving the Bloch sphere

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
into the middle, because you're taking this,

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you're multiplying it by 1 minus q,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and you're adding q amount of diagonal.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Or q amount of the identity.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So that goes here.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And in general, this is going to go to an ellipsoid.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is still zero.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is still 1.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And this is 1, 1 minus q, 1 minus q, 1, et cetera.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So you shrink the Bloch sphere into an ellipsoid

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
with the vertical axis stays the same and everything else

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
shrinks by the same factor.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So this is the phasing in Bloch picture.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
