1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last time, we talked about the states of quantum information.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And we can view density matrices as

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a simultaneous generalization of both pure-state quantum

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
mechanics and classical probability theory.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, I want to talk about dynamics.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We saw that there were these, in the different models,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
there's various versions of dynamics.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In probability theory, you have stochastic maps.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In pure-state quantum mechanics, you

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
have unitary transformations.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And today, we'll talk about quantum operations, which

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
are the ones that apply to density matrices, this most

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
general of the possible states, once you take both quantum

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
mechanics and probability into account.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So at the end of last lecture, I gave you a few examples.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, I want to give a complete characterization.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Actually, I want to have three complete characterizations.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I'll begin with the first one that's known as the Stinespring

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
representation of a channel.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's just a name.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's significant about this one is that it's operational.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So this first one corresponds to the way

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you may think of a quantum operation actually happening

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in the world.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Especially if you're used to the Schrodinger equation,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
this will be the one that is the most natural.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's the most natural physically in some ways,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but it's not always the most natural to calculate with.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the second definition I'll mention,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which follows naturally from the first one,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is called the Kraus operator representation.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And this one has the advantage of being the simplest

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to write down.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And in calculations, it's often the first one

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that you want to use.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Once we're armed with this, I'll be able to give some examples

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of quantum channels, both some that you've seen before in this

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
formalism, as well as some that you haven't.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000


40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Finally, I'll give a third definition,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
which is a more axiomatic one.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we're used to--

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
for stochastic matrices, you can think of them

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
as these are the linear maps that keep things

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
non-negative and summing to 1.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For unitary matrices, these are the linear maps

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that preserve the Euclidean length of a vector.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we can similarly taken axiomatic approach

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to quantum channels, and this describes quantum operations

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
as TCPC maps, trace-preserving completely positive maps.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll say more about what that means later.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Finally, I'll talk about one very important special case

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
of quantum operations, which are ones

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
have a quantum input and a classical output,

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
otherwise known as measurements.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'll use this way of describing

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
them to explain a little bit more

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
about the geometry of quantum states and measurements

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
in terms of various matrix norms.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Any questions before I begin?

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
