00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This will lead us to something called the trace norm,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it suggests that there is a-- the natural

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
metric on the set of states is the one norm,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
whereas the natural metric on the set of measurements

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is the Schatten infinity norm.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And so, the metric on the set of states

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is sometimes called the trace norm.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And it's defined T, stands for trace norm,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and it's defined to be one half of the Schatten, one

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
distance between rho and sigma.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The one half is just convention.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You'll see on the problems set why it's a natural convention.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the way it's always between 0 and 1,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
instead of being between 0 and 2.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000


16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the reason why this is the natural metric

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to use for states is that for any measurement M,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we have that trace of M rho, minus trace of M sigma.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So this is the difference, if I measure rho,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or I measure sigma, the difference in the probability

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of some outcome.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So essentially, it's how far away observable probabilities

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
can be from each other.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I can write this as absolute value trace M rho minus sigma.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So by the duality relation, says that the maximum inner product

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
of M with rho minus sigma comes when I--

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
yeah, let me restate that.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This duality relation, you can rewrite

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
by saying that the norm of x star

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is the maximum in a product that you get.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But what that means is that for any particular x and y,

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
their inner product is upper-bounded by their norms.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So just as an aside, so the duality relation

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
says that the inner product of x and y

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
is less than or equal to the norm of x in one norm,

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and the norm of y in another norm.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So this kind of, like the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
for Euclidean vectors, right?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For Euclidean vectors, their inner product

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is at most the product of their two norms.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you're using two different dual norms,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you can measure the form of one vector with one norm,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and the other vector with the other norm.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And that's kind of just rewriting this equation

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
with a max up here.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The maxium goes a little bit further

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and says that if you hold x fixed,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
there will be some choice of y that saturates this.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But even in general, this is always an inequality.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that means that this quantity here

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
can be upper-bounded by the Schatten infinity norm of M,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and the Schatten one norm of rho minus sigma.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000


54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And now you see, maybe, why it's useful to use duality and use

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
these norms.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to be measuring measurements in the S infinity

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
norm, and states in the S1 norm.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't want to, for example, just use the Euclidean norm

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
for both.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That would be very wasteful.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It would be very--

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
it'd be an inequality that would be true,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but it'd be very loose.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Whereas this thing is--

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
can generally be made tight, if I choose

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the measurement the right way.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So now I can upper-bound this quantity by one, right?

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Any measurement has Schatten infinity norm at most one.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so I just get the S1 norm of rho minus sigma,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which is equal to twice the trace distance.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And so this gives you a sense of why the trace distance,

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
how it bounds the probability, the discrepancy

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
between any observable outcome.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because if I change, if I replaced a rho with state sigma

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and they're close in trace distance,

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
then the output of any measurement

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
will not change too much.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let me just mention about this last derivation.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This 2 here, is not needed.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If I had done this derivation a little more carefully,

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I could have done it without this factor of 2.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I wanted to kind of quickly show you why it's the case,

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but if you go through it, actually on the piece

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that you'll go through it in a way, that doesn't

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
have this factor of two.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This still contains, I think, the essential idea.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I just want to make sure that you, you know,

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
don't think this is the actual formula.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The actual formula lacks this factor of 2.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I mean, this is still true, right?

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
