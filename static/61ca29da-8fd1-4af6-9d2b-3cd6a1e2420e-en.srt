00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The thing that's at first a little daunting

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
about correcting noise, is that in the classical case

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you can say, well, there's only so many patterns of bitflips

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have to deal with.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a finite number.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And in the case of linear codes, I don't even

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
have to worry about mapping from this string to that string,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I just have to worry about which bits are flipped, right.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That I can analyze independent of which bits I started with.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For channels, there is a continuously, infinite number

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of these.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And so, I can't hope to identify all of them.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But the key idea of quantum error correction,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is to use linearity to benefit you.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And so we find that codes can usually

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
correct not just one channel, but the entire subspace

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
of channels.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's let s be the set of correctable errors.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000


20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A key fact about quantum codes is

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that this is a subspace of operators on N qubits.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is a linear subspace.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000


24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And this is what will allow us to deal

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
with a continuum of possible errors.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It says if I can correct error a and error b,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
then I can also correct any linear combination of them.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And so that is what makes it tractable to--

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you know why we don't have to worry

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
about the continuous range of possibilities.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
OK, what does it mean to correct an error that's a matrix?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I said here that noise is a super operator.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right, a quantum operation.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And these are--

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm saying s it's just a matrix.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The connection is a quantum operation

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
has a collection of Kraus operators.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we say that a quantum operation is correctable

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
if it's Kraus operators are in this set.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So in other words, N is correctable--

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
sorry, let me let me say suppose N of row

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
is equal to sum over i--

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000


44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
let me call it let's say, Ei rho, Ei dagger, then

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and is correctable if each Ei belong to this correctable set.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
OK.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So this is the set of correctable Kraus operators.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And-- and so these conditions--

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
when I say it's correctable, I mean

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
that these conditions hold.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000


52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So when I say and it's correctable,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I mean that the decoding map will correctly undo the noise.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The recovery map will correctly undo the noise.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000


56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So this is material that was in eight 370,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
so I'm not going to derive it in great detail.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But let me give you some argument why this is plausible

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
based on this picture of quantum operations

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that we've just seen.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000


62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We can encode an isometry.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And that's plausible because our code spaces are linear.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Again, you could imagine nonlinear encodings, right.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
An encoding in principle doesn't have

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to be physically realizable, it could just

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
be some mathematical operation.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But we almost-- that sort of expands the set of codes

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to make it so general it's hard to make use of.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And in almost every case we care about,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we can do linear encoding.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But why should the decoding be a quantum operation?

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why can't this be--

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you know, isometries are simple--

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
simpler than quantum operations.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why do we need the quantum operation for decoding?

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why do we have to introduce non-unitarity and potentially

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
noise in our decoding map?

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can anyone-- can anyone say why?

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
[INAUDIBLE]

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, if you do everything you unitarily,

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you neither create nor destroy information.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The noise introduces some information.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
For example, which noise process happened

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
will presumably leave some amount of information

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in your system.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You want to get rid of that.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And so this is a way of discarding that information.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The other reason-- and that's true for the recovery

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
map and the decoding map.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
At the level of the decoding map,

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
there's another reason, which is even more basic,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which is k is less than N, right.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I mean coding-- so this map is going from more N qubits

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to a fewer qubits.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Down to k.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so, that, inevitably, is going to lose information.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No matter what error correcting properties I want,

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm just going to fewer qubits.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I have to go--

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
