1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you're in this class, you've probably already taken

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
an introductory class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You probably have an idea of what quantum information

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
science is, but let me give you anyway

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
my perspective on it, which starts from the way

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that classical computer science abstracts away

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
device independent fundamentals to come up

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with the notion of bits.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So for classical information, we have

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
things like RAM, magnetic tape, beads on an abacus,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the idea of classical computer

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
science at a very, very high level as we abstract all these

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
away to the notion of bits.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can reason about bits without caring

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
about the physical substrate.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Of course, if you want to know how to build it,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
or how easy it is to manipulate, some

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of these physical substrates are more convenient than others.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But you can reason about things like how multiplication gates

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
work, without having to know about which physical substrate

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you're talking about.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so, there was an idea for a long time

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that this is all there was to it.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you just reasoned about bits, or about Turing machines, then

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
this captured the computation that

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
was possible in the physical world, and any model

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of computation that people came up with,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
DNA computers, whatever, always could be

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
described by manipulating bits.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Quantum mechanics came along, and we

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
realized that wasn't true.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But still it wasn't completely open either.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So there was something new that came along

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
with quantum mechanics, but still we

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
found that we could abstract away

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
from the different types of quantum information

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that appear.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So in quantum information, we might have spins,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:13,000
photons, orbitals of an electron,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the degrees of freedom of a superconducting circuit,

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and all of these we can abstract away into talking about qubits.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This level of abstraction leaves behind some of the physics,

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
right?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you know about qubits, that doesn't

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
mean that you know everything about how photons work.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But it does mean that you can talk about their information,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
storing, carrying, and processing characteristics.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And if you understand qubits, then that's

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
a common feature of all these different forms

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of quantum information.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And so the fact that quantum mechanics describes

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
many different kinds of systems doesn't change,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it doesn't mean that you can't summarize it computationally

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
just with the notion of qubits.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And so, just like these different forms

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of classical information are all abstract into bits,

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
these different forms of quantum information

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
are all abstracted into qubits.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And so again, we find that we can abstract away

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
from the specific devices.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We still have to take account physics,

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
in order to have qubits rather than bits,

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but we don't need to know further detail in order

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to know what kind of information processing is possible.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000


67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So what can we do with qubits?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you took a 8.370, then you saw kind of the basics

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
of quantum information.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000


71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You saw some quantum algorithms, some quantum error correction,

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and other models of computation, such as the adiabatic

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
or measurement-based models.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
