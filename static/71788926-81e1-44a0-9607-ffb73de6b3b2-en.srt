1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I want to give you one more way of looking

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
at this projector in a way that I

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
think gives some more insight into what these stabilizers are

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
doing.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And the way I like to think about the stabilizers

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is they're really--

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you know, each one is adding a new constraint, just

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
like that for the classical linear codes.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're imposing these parity constraints.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Every stabilizer generator is imposing a new fresh constraint

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on your quantum state.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And this formula up here for pi s is very beautiful,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and in some cases very nice to use,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but it doesn't really get across that constraint picture,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
because it just looks like I'm averaging

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
over a bunch of things, each one of which

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is rotating in a different way, and somehow the good vectors

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
are unaffected by it and the bad vectors cancel out.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't really see the constraint in that.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let me rephrase it in a way that

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
looks like I'm applying a bunch of independent constraints.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So once I have a bunch of generators,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can write pi s as 1 over 2 to the l, sum over a.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I said that a is 0, 1, but I could also

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
say F 2 to the l, because once I have the value 2,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that's as good as having 0.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
s1 to the a1, through sl to the al.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So now I'm summing over a vector of l entries

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and a product over l things.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And 1 over 2 to the l--

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can break this up as a product from i through 1 through l,

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
sum over ai in F2 of si to the ai over 2.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000


34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm just rearranging this sum.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then this inner thing--

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
maybe I can write it again without the summation.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is product over i equals 1 to l.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Identity plus si over 2.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000


40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And now what's this?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This thing in parentheses--

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
what eigenvalues does it have?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000


44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So I heard plus minus 1, but those are the eigenvalues

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of a Pauli matrix, right?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What about this thing?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah?

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
0, 1.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Right. si's going to be plus minus 1.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Add 1, 0, 2.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Divide by 2, 0, 1.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So these are projectors.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And they're projectors where half the space has eigenvalue 1

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and half the space has eigenvalue 0.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the space that has eigenvalue 1--

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that's the same as the part where si has eigenvalue 1.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So we're just projecting onto the plus 1 eigenspace--

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000


59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
projector onto the plus one eigenspace of si.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And these projectors all commute,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because the sis commute.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So what we're doing is, each one of these generators

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
corresponds to an independent constraint.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we just impose, one after another,

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
each one of these constraints.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then that leaves us with our overall projector, pi sub s.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OK, so just to give you a little example of what this looks

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
like for one qubit.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000


70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Identity plus Z over 2 projects onto the 0 state.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Identity minus Z over 2 projects onto the 1 state, et cetera.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You know, these projectors just single out

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the plus 1 eigenspace of the respective Pauli operator.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
F2 just means numbers 0 and 1 with addition modulo 2.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000


76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I talked about it more when we were

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
