0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What does that look like if you have

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
three real numbers whose sum of their squares

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
adds up to at most 1.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That looks like the unit ball.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we have a sphere.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000


7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And at the origin is at 0.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And everything inside of this sphere--

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000


10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
corresponds to a valid density matrix.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is something called--

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000


13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the bloch ball.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And you may have previously come across the bloch sphere--

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000


16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which corresponds to the states where the norm of a is 1.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So the surface of the ball--

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so the ball is all point for a has norm less than

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or equal to 1.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your distance to the origin is at most 1.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The sphere is where your distance to the origin

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is exactly 1.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So the bloch sphere corresponds to these points.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And here when you plug in at the norm of a is 1,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you get the d eigenvalues are 0 and 1.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So these correspond-- to pure states.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For example, if you have I plus or minus--

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000


29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
sigma 3 over 2.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then this is 1--

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
1 plus or minus 1 minus 1 over 2.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if you have the plus branch--

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000


34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
this gives you a 1 in the upper left corner.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the minus branch it's a 1 in the lower right corner.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So it's either the projector onto 0--

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000


38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
or onto 1.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And if you remember in the bloch sphere,

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
0 is often the north pole--

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
1 is the south pole.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And that corresponds to what's happening geometrically here.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because this plus or minus sigma 3 corresponds to the vectors

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
0, 0 plus or minus 1.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In other words, that unit vector pointing

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
at either up in the z direction or down in the z direction.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And you can do similar things in the x and y directions.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So you can take a unit vector pointing the x direction.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You get what's called the plus state which

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
is 0 plus 1 over root 2.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This way is the minus state to 0 minus 1 over root 2.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And these give you back all the familiar points

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in the bloch sphere.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But you also get points in the interiors.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So this is how densely matrices generalize pure states.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
One particular point that you get is if a is 0, right.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So a is anything less than or equal to 1-- could be 0.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this corresponds to the center of the ball, the origin,

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where there's no--

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the things multiplied by the polys are just 0.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're just left with identity over 2.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And so this is sometimes called--

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000


64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the maximally-- mixed state.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:45,000


66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then we can interpolate between this

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and any other state.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So along this line from the maximally mixed state to the 0

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
state, you can have a state where

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
there's some probability of being 0

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and some probability of being 1.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the maximally mixed state is the perfectly balanced point

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
where you could think of it as you

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
have a half probability of being 0

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and half probability of being 1.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Or half probability of being plus--

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
half probability of being minus.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or you can choose any other direction that you like.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
