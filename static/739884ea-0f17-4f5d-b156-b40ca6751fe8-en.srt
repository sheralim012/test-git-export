00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we've made some progress in figuring out what Cliffords do.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
They change, you could say, the flavor of the poly--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
whether it's an x or a z, and what qubits--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
by a linear transformation.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And then they do something a little more complicated

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
for the phase.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For coding purposes, we're often happy just

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to figure out what happens to the flavor of the poly.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So that's nice.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But we haven't finished.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because not all matrices M are possible.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So which M are possible.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We know-- for example, I argued before--

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that M equals 0 is impossible.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000


16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Because if M is 0, that's like saying that g of v

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is always 0, that you map every poly to the identity--

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or plus or minus the identity.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That would not work.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So not all M's are possible.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we need to do a little more work to figure out

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which M's are possible here.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000


24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And to do this, I want to go back to that top equation

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
up there, the commutation relations.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sigma v sigma w sigma v sigma w is plus or minus identity,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
where that plus or minus is described

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
by the symplectic inner product between v and w.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000


30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You know, I think when I wrote it

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
before, I said sigma v sigma w is minus 1 to this times

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
sigma w sigma v. But multiply both on the right by sigma v,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and then both on the right by sigma w,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and you get this equation.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
OK, so now let's use the fact that if I

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
conjugate the right side by u, then nothing happens.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I conjugate the identity by u, I get back the identity.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If I conjugate the left hand side by u,

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that's the same as conjugating every single term.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So I could write this as u sigma v u dagger u sigma w u dagger u

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
sigma v u dagger u sigma w u dagger.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And now, I can use what we figured out so far--

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that it turns sigma v into sigma gv, which is sigma Mv--

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to write this as sigma Mv sigma Mw sigma Mv sigma Mw.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000


47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I haven't written any phases.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why is that OK?

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000


50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I said phases are complicated.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
[INAUDIBLE]

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So each of these appears twice.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I should've written minus 1 to the something times sigma

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mv.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And over here, minus 1 to the same thing times sigma Mv.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Those are going to cancel out.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I'm lucky that those phases do not trouble us here.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, it's not surprising.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The phases commute with everything.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So if we want to understand commutation relations,

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
phases are not going to affect it.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000


66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
OK, so now we do the same kind of trick,

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
where we use this equation twice, on the original

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and on the transformed states.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So this we can write as minus 1 Mv transpose sigma

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mw times identity.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000


72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So we have identity in both places times different phases.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So those must be equal, at least modulo 2.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And we're thinking about everything in f2.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So they're equal as elements of f2.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So we have that v transpose sigma w is equal to--

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
here we can evaluate this as v transpose M transpose lambda

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Mw.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And this is equal in the f2 sense.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And this equality is true for all v and w.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so if two matrices are equal,

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
when you sandwich them by any row

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
vector on the left and any column vector on the right,

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that means that they're equal as matrices.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So this is equivalent to just saying

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that lambda is equal to M transpose lambda M.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So we obtain this identity of matrices.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000


89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And this turns out to be the condition

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that we'll need on M. We've derived that M should always

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
satisfy this.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Conversely, if M does satisfy this,

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it means that the transformation preserves

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
commutation relations.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000


96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And this equation here, it might look a little bit funny.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To get some perspective on it, you

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
might imagine that we replace lambda with the identity.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So if we did that, what would we say about the matrix M?

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If we replaced lambda with identity,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
what could you say about M then?

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a rotation?

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's a rotation.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's also called an orthogonal matrix.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I guess it could be a reflection also.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But the key property of an orthogonal matrix--

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
which is a product of a rotation and an optional reflection--

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is that it preserves the length, specifically

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the Euclidean length, specifically

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the Euclidean inner product.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And the Euclidean inner product is

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
when you take the row vector and then the identity matrix

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and then the column vector.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're using the symplectic inner product.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The symplectic inner product, you

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
put this lambda in the middle.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And so these matrices M are precisely

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the ones that preserve the symplectic inner product.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In other words, here the inner product of v and w

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is the same as the inner product of Mw with Mv.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So we say that the set of such matrices--

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
so M is in what's called the symplectic group.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's the set of--

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the symplectic group is a set of matrices

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that preserve the symplectic inner product,

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
just like the orthogonal group is

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
what preserves the ordinary Euclidean inner product.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000


130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so you can really--

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
except for the fact that it's a funny inner product--

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you can really think about them kind of geometrically,

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that these vectors have an inner product,

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and that allow transformations of the ones that

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
preserve that inner product.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
