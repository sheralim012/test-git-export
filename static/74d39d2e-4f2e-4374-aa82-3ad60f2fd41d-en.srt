00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what if you have a depolarizing channel?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What's going on is each qubit is getting taken to--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000


4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is 1 minus p, you get an i.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The probability p over 3, you get a sigma x.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Probability p over 3, you get a sigma y.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And probability p over 3, you get a sigma z.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000


9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So what you can do is 1 minus p cubed, you get i, i, i.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
1 minus p squared p, you get i over 3.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You get ii sigma x, ii sigma y, ii sigma z, i

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
sigma x i sigma xii, et cetera.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So with probability 1 minus p squared times p over 3,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you get each of these things.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So suppose you have n cubics depolarizing channel.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000


17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, you can use classical probability theory

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to say that with high probability, no more than pn

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
plus o of square root of n have errors.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000


21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So if you can fix this number of qubits,

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
then you can send quantum information

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
with high fidelity over a depolarizing channel.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
