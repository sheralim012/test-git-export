00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Armed with this picture, we can now simplify it a little bit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And we can move on to the Kraus operator picture.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So this isometry-- let's look at the isometry first.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The isometry map system A to B tensor E.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let me fix a basis for system E, an orthonormal basis,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I should say.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000


8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And in terms of this, let me partially

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
expand the isometry V. Let me write it as sum over e,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
V e tensor cat e, where each V e is

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a linear map from A to B. OK?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I can write V as V1, V2, and so on.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now, each are-- these are blocks,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
sort of a block decomposition of V.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So what do we know about these blocks?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, the only thing we know about V

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
is that it's an isometry.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Otherwise it's completely arbitrary.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The isometry condition says identity

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
is equal to V dagger V. We can expand it out

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
in terms of this V sub e.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is sum over e1, V e1 dagger, raw e1, sum e2, V

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
e 2 dagger cat e2.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We get a delta function on the e1, e2.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so we get that identity is equal to sum over

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
e V e dagger V e.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000


29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And so these are the conditions we have on the V sub e.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
These are called the Kraus operator conditions.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And these V e can also be used to fully describe

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
how the channel acts.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So let's write down how this looks.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So remember, N of rho is trace over the environment of V rho V

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
dagger.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we can write this out as partial trace of sum

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:52,000
over e1 e2 V e 1 rho V e 2 dagger tensor e1 e2.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000


39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now we can apply the partial trace.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Like the trace, the partial trace is linear,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and it acts only on the second system.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The partial trace here gives us [? raw ?] e2 times cat e1.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
These are orthonormal, so it gives us a delta function.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So we obtain sum over e, V e rho V e dagger.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me write again, N of rho is equal to this.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000


47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And this gives us a nice, simple way

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
of describing the action of a quantum channel.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000


50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let me call this actually description number

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
two, the Kraus operator decomposition of a channel.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And these V sub e are called Kraus operators.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's a few things about this that are appealing.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One of the key ones is that, for the isometry picture,

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we had to invoke this extra system, which then

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
got thrown away at the end.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Kraus operators, these V sub e, are just maps from A

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to B. Kind of directly involving the systems

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that you care about.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the formula is also in a sense simpler.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's almost the simplest thing you

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
could have after mapping rho to U rho U dagger.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is what you get from unitary operations.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It says, it's just a sum over things

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that have that basic form.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000


67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The difference, of course, is that the isometry condition,

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or the unitary condition, looks rather different.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If I have a single Kraus operator,

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
there was no sum in other words, if you would just

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
say that that Kraus operator is an isometry.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But if I have many of them, then the individual ones

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
do not have to be isometries.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In general, they will not be.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They don't even have to be full rank.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They can be whatever you like as long as they add up

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to the identity.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So you have a lot of freedom in the individual Kraus operators,

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
