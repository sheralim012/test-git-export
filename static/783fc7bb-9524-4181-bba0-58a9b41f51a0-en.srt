1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, I'm going to tell you about quantum states

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and operations.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And some of this you may have seen before.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I know that density matrices were introduced in 8.370.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So there'll be an element of review to this,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but I hope also some aspects that are new for everyone.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So the basic object of our theory, as I mentioned,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is a qubit.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And so what is the state of a qubit?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In-- to see this, we'll begin, actually,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with bits, or with deterministic classical information,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then I'll show you how you can

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
think of quantum information as generalizing bits

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in a way that's analogous, but not equivalent,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to the way the probability theory generalizes

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
deterministic classical theories.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So when you think about the state space, you can--

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we can divide it up into classical, or quantum,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and we can think of a classical state space

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
as being like a bit, which is zero or one,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and I'll generalize that slightly to say it's

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
an object which can take on some finite number of values.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So let's say it can take on d different values.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So a classical object we might describe

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
by a number between one and d.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
OK.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And then quantum-- puristic quantum mechanics

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
generalized this and, it says, the quantum analog of such a

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
deed level system is a d dimensional complex vector.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, for example, classically, we might think of a electron

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as being either in the ground state or an excited state.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Quantumly, we would describe that by a vector space

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
with some amplitude for each of these--

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
for each of these cases.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, quantumly, we would say that we have a vector si in c d

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
with two norm equal to one.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000


38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So this is kind of the standard picture

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that you see in quantum mechanics.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That you have a classical system that can

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
be in some number of states.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The quantum analog of this is to add superposition.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And when you hear descriptions of this,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you often hear things like the electron

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
is in a cloud around the nucleus, and if you measure it,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
it turns out to be in a random location.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
These descriptions often sound a lot like probability.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this kind of looks like probability.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You have some wave function, which,

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
if you take the absolute value square,

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it gives you something normalized,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that something analogous but different than probability.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where probabilities, you just have

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a bunch of non-negative real numbers that add up to one.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And-- and you realize that these probability

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
is a sort of incomparable generalization

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
of the classical deterministic theory.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So let me add another access to this graph.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let me write deterministic and random.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So if you have a classical theory with randomness,

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
this gives you something that's like superposition,

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but instead is--

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is called probability.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have a probability distribution p, which

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is a list of d real numbers.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000


67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They add up to one.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000


69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And they're each non-negative, right?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So you have d non-negative real numbers that add up to one.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And you can see this is analogous to quantum states.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it's not-- it's definitely not equivalent.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can-- if you measure a quantum state,

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
you get a probability distribution,

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but you don't have to.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Those are kind of-- they're different things.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And they're, in a sense, incomparable because I

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
could have a probability distribution over quantum

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
states, right?

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Nothing stops me from saying, with probability of one-half,

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the quantum state is like this.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
With probability of one-third, it's like this.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
With probability of one-sixth, it's something else.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And so you realize that either of these theories by themselves

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
are incomplete.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The world is not always in a known quantum state,

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it could be in an unknown quantum state.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And so to really have a complete picture,

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we need a common generalization of both probability and quantum

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
mechanics.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We need to talk about random quantum states.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And here is where we have density matrices.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And there-- there are two ways of thinking about it.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I'll write here density matrices,

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then we'll unpack that a little bit further.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
