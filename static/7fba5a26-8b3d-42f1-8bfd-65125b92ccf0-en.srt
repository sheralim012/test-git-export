1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let us begin with a description of quantum mechanics,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and a brief overview of elements of quantum circuits.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The basic elements we need for this course

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
are captured entirely by four postulates.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They cover states, gates, measurement, and composition.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Postulate 1 describes how states are

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
defined in the context of isolated physical systems.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Basically, we take any system such as a spin one half,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and represent it as a state vector within a Hilbert space,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is an inner product vector space.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The state space may have an infinite number of dimensions.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For example, such as with a harmonic oscillator system.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You may also be quite familiar from quantum mechanics

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
with the use of continuous variables, such as position,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in describing the quantum states.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
However, in our study of quantum information science,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we will largely be interested in discrete Hilbert spaces.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Keep in mind that these Hilbert spaces

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
are complex vector spaces with an inner product that

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is defined.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
States are thus vectors, such as this zero state being

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
1,0 and the one state being 0,1, two component vectors which

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
are spinors, or are otherwise known as qubits

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in quantum information science.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So that tells us about states.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let us now move on to Postulate 2, which talks about gates.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Gates describe the evolution of closed quantum systems, i.e.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
isolated systems, and thus will be unitary transforms.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Specifically, the unitary transform

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
will govern how a state psi evolves from the initial time,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
t1, to some final time, t2.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Psi 1 and psi 2 are thus related by a matrix U which

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
multiplies a state vector psi 1 to produce a state vector

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
psi 2.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This unitary transform has a property

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that U dagger U is equal to identity,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
namely that it is a unitary matrix.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Describing quantum gates is a core concept

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for quantum circuits.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thus, let us consider a few examples of quantum gates.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Specifically, let us look at the action of a few common quantum

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
gates on qubits.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Recall the state zero.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The X gate-- 0,1, 1,0, a two by two

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
matrix-- acts on the zero state to give the one state,

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
as is shown by this simple matrix multiplication.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thus, this X gate may be considered the quantum analog

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of the classical NOT gate.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A really uniquely quantum gate is this transform,

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which is described by the two by two matrix 1,1, 1, minus 1.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is the Hadamard gate.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Hadamard gate acts on 0 to give

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a superposition of 0 and 1, an equal superposition

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
with coefficients 1 over square root of 2.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That is, the two-component vector 1 over

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
square root of 2, 1 over square root of 2.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can check for yourself that the Hadamard operator

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
is its own inverse.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OK.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The example we just finished was a gate

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
acting on a single qubit space.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let us now look at a slightly more complicated example

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of a gate acting on a slightly larger Hilbert space.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is a state in a four-dimensional Hilbert

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
space with four coefficients, which are arbitrary.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Of course, subject to normalization.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We may also write the state as a sum over basis vectors, which

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
are labeled 0 through 3 with coefficient c sub x rather than

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
a through d. That's the same.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We may also write it as a four component

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
vector in this inner product Hilbert space.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The unitary transform we'll look at

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is this four by four matrix with 0s and 1s.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Note that the columns and rows are

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
labeled by the same basis vectors as in the state

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that we just described.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thus, the first column and row act

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
on the top-most label, and the bottom right

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
acts on the bottom label.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can therefore work out straightforwardly by a matrix

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
multiplication that the action of U on psi

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is to flip the labels 2 and 3.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This should not be a surprise, because after all U

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is a permutation matrix.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So it permutes the labels of the state.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now that we have gone through two gate examples,

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
let us move on to Postulate 3.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This postulate describes measurements.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Measurements are going to be described

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
by a collection of measurement operators, M sub m.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And these operators act in the state space of the system being

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
measured with an index m.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The index describes some possible measurement outcomes

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that may occur when the measurement is done.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
M occurs with probability given by an inner product

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
of the state being measured and the measurement operator.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Measurement changes the quantum state.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If an initial state psi is measured,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
then the post-measurement state is given by this expression.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Basically, a product of M with a state

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
divided by the probability of the measurement result being

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
obtained.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It is important to keep in mind that these Ms are

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
pretty arbitrary.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The only constraint is that the sum of M dagger M

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
must be identity.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Ms need not be square.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
For example, Ms may be projection operators.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The operator formed by the product of two Ms

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
may be familiar to you from a different context.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They are also known as positive operator-valued measures.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Measurements are something we will return to a great deal

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
later.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So for now, let us move on to the fourth postulate,

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
composition.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is how we mathematically describe

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
how individual physical systems may

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
be described as a composite.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mathematically, it is like digits.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These digits are tensor products for linear vector spaces.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For example, if we combine two qubit states,

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
there are four possible outcomes.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If we have n qubits, there are clearly

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
2 to the n possible outcomes.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And these are basis vectors for the new inner product Hilbert

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
space, which is the combination of the n qubits.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let us look at some examples of composition.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Consider two qubits.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We may easily write them as two digits like this.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sometimes, we'll explicitly write the tensor product

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
operator, as well.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A Hadamard operator acting on the two qubits written

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
like this represents the tensor product

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
of the Hadamard acting on the two individual qubits.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We may work out what that is explicitly simply

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
by taking the tensor product of the two superposition states.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Note that the tensor product distributes over addition.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thus, this expression yields a superposition

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
over the four basis vectors.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Incidentally, it is common and convenient to represent

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
these binary vectors often by integers.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
00 is 0.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
01 is 1, et cetera, such that we may write this superposition

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
state also as a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
An expression common in quantum information science

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is thus the use of n Hadamard operators acting on n qubits,

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
initially at 0, producing an equal superposition

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
over all basis vectors labeled from 0 to 2

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to the n minus 1 written out as integers.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is very useful.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
x is just the set of all binary strings that have n bits.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's now also look at some examples

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
of tensor product structure described

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
with quantum circuits.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Here, I show a 0 qubit state going through a single Hadamard

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
gate, giving the equal superposition we've

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
previously seen.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We may do this twice, with two quantum circuits.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And this is simply described as the tensor product of the two.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, there is a much more interesting case

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
than two separate qubits undergoing gates like that.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Recall that we had looked at this unitary transform

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
on a four-dimensional Hilbert space.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We may also consider this unitary transform

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
as acting on a two qubit composite space.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So let's take two qubits, both in their zero state.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And we'll represent this transform

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
by the following circuit diagram.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That circuit symbol is known as a controlled NOT gate.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The first qubit controls whether a NOT,

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
an X gate, happens to the second qubit, the one on the bottom.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If we replace the first part of this circuit

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
with a Hadamard acting on a zero state,

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
then we actually get something far more non-trivial.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Recall that the Hadamard gives an equal superposition state.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And what we find is the output of this controlled NOT gate

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
gives a 2 qubit state, which is much more interesting.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is known as an entangled state.

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we'll come back to this later in the course.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
OK.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That ends our brief journey through the four

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
basic postulates of quantum mechanics

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
which we'll use regarding states, gates, measurement,

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and composition.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Basically, this is all we need about the fundamentals

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
of quantum mechanics for quantum information science.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
