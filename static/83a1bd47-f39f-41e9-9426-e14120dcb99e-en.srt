1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Back to the physics of it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So this is how we mathematically describe the partial trace.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It certainly doesn't look unitary.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I mean, among other things, unitary is preserved dimension.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This can obviously destroy information, right?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I take a system and then I've erased it, effectively.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So why is this possible?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, the system isn't really destroyed, it just left my lab.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So if there is a photon that bounces off

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of an atom in my lab and then flies off into space,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the photon is still there.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I just don't have access to it anymore.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So from my perspective, it's as good as gone.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And then there might be situations

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
where it goes into a place where it's inconvenient to retrieve,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but with effort I can retrieve it.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can always imagine versions of this,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but if you just consider the state of the system

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
without that photon, then it's described by the partial trace.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so that's how you can have effective, non-unitary dynamics

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in a unitary world.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There's a lot of philosophical consequences

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that come out of this, which I won't talk about.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But one important one is that this

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is the only thing-- this is not only a source of non-unitarity,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it's effectively the only source of non-unitarity.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So I'm going to describe maps from density matrices

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to density matrices, things that can look noisy.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But there is no new physics beyond the Schrodinger

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
equation, right?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is just bookkeeping.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm adding a system to the set of things I'm keeping track of.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm removing a system from the set of things

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm keeping track of.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No physical changes happen, it's just

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
sort of how I'm organizing my knowledge has changed.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I claim that is enough for everything non-unitary

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
