1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We now employ the stabilizer formalism

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to define a family of quantum codes, which

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is the analog of classical linear codes.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The n, k stabilizer code C of S

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is defined as the k qubit vector subspace of an n qubit Hilbert

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
space, stabilized by the stabilizer

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
S, a subgroup of the n qubit Pauli group where

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
S has the generators g1 through gn minus k.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We have previously seen how the nine qubit quantum

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
code is an example of this kind of definition.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Stabilizer codes satisfy the quantum error correction

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
criteria in the following way.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Given a set of errors, E sub a, which

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
are in the Pauli group on n qubits,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
if there exists an element g in S,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
such that g anti-commutes with E,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and this is true for all E, which are a product of any two

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
errors, that is e is equal to E sub a times E sub b,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
then there will exist a recovery operation, namely a syndrome

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
measurement and the recovery operator which

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
corrects all the errors in this set, E sub a, on this code

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
C of S.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We prove this theorem by reducing it

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to the orthogonality and non-deformation criteria

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of the quantum error correction conditions.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First, we note that for all states psi in C of s

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and for all stabilizers g in S, the matrix element of psi E

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a, E b psi, is given by psi E times g times psi,

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
because psi is a plus 1 eigenstate of g.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now by the theorem, E and g anti-commute, so

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this is minus psi gE psi.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But again, psi is an eigenstate of g,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and note g is Hermitian because g is a Pauli operator,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and therefore, this is equal to minus of itself, meaning

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it must be zero.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This proves we satisfy the orthogonality criteria

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of the quantum error correction conditions,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
namely that psi l E times any two errors in product

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
must be equal to zero.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That is errors do not cause once code word state to transform

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
into another code word state.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
For the non-deformation criteria, we look at the case

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
when E sub a equals E sub b.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In this scenario, when E sub b equals E sub b, because they

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
are both Pauli operators we find the product is identity.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This then trivially shows us that

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the non-deformation criterion is satisfied with d sub k

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
equal to 1.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stabilizer codes thus give a very simple prescription

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
for checking for error correction criteria,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
namely we check to see if an error anti-commutes

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
with a stabilizer element.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It is thus convenient to define for a given generator

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
set of a stabilizer, g sub 1 through g sub k,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and for error E, a error syndrome.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a bit string the size of the stabilizer generator

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
set where each bit is zero if the generator commutes

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
with an error and one otherwise, namely it anti-commutes.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This error syndrome bit string will

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
be used to determine where the error occurred

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and what to do about the error.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And in the case when each error has a unique syndrome string,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the code will be known as a non-degenerate code.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Degenerate codes, on the other hand,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
will have non-unique syndromes.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let us look at some example stabilizer codes.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
First, recall the 3-qubit qubit bit flip code

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
with stabilizer generators IZZ and ZZI.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If the error is, for example, a bit flip on the middle qubit,

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
than the syndrome will be one and one,

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
indicating that both generators anti-commute with the error.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What if the error were three bit flips?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All qubits being flipped, what would the syndrome be?

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, go work this out for yourself,

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but note something interesting.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This error does not anti-commute with any of the generators.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's look at another interesting example.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Suppose that the stabilizers were generated

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
by a single operator, XX.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In this case, the vector space stabilized, C of S,

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the code word space, is spanned by 00 plus 11, and 01 plus 10.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Suppose the error were a single phase flip, IZ or ZI.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have to be careful, in this case,

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when computing the error syndrome

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
because actually, the product of the two errors is Z Z,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and this error, Z Z, commutes with X X, the stabilizer.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So in this case, what we have is an error detection code which

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
detects phase errors but cannot correct for the phase errors.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Here's a third example of a four qubit state

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
with four stabilizer generators, XZIZ

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and its cyclic permutations, ZXZI, IZXZ, and ZIZX.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000


93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Again, n is equal to 4 and k equals 0,

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
meaning it's a state and not a space.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What errors anti-commute with these generators?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It turns out that any single qubit

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
error does, but no qubit is encoded by this code

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
because k equals 0.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now let us look at a important seven qubit code example.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You will see this code later in your problem set.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The stabilizer generators are constructed by a nice pattern.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Namely, we iterate from 1 through 7 by column, like this.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So we have binary 001 going all the way up to binary 111 with

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
X's and then with Z's.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This gives us a total of six generators labeled

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
g1 through g6, acting on the seven qubits

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and therefore, we have one encoded qubit

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
in seven physical qubits.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It is straightforward and instructive to look at all 64

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
possible syndrome values resulting from single qubit

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
errors I, X, Y, or Z. This is to be contrasted

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
with the number of possible errors that could occur,

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
namely 22 possible errors.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This code is, of course, the famous 7,

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
1 Steane code where every single qubit

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
error has a unique syndrome and, by the stabilizer code theorem,

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
is correctable.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This shows that we have a beautiful description

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
of the Steane code as being a stabilizer code.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Here is, as a final example, a code

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
with n equal 5 qubits, with the stabilizer generators

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
XZZXI and its cyclic permutations, that

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is, IXZZX, XIXZZ, and ZXIXZ.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Again, we have five physical qubits

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
encoding one logical qubit, giving us a 5, 1 quantum error

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
correction code.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is a stabilizer code with some remarkable properties.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can verify for yourself that for arbitrary single qubit

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
errors, such as X1, we get a unique set of syndrome

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
strings, written here in order of the generators listed above.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So for example, Z1 gives us 1010 and X2

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
gives us 1000, and so forth, for all possible single qubit

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
errors.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Just as for the Steane code, every single qubit error

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
has a unique error syndrome and thus,

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
this code, which has fewer qubits, five qubits,

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
can correct for an arbitrary single qubit error.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is the perfect 5-qubit quantum error correction code.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In many ways, it is a particularly uniquely quantum

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
code in that it has no origin in a classical linear code,

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
unlike the Steane code, which has its origins in the 7-bit Hamming code.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
