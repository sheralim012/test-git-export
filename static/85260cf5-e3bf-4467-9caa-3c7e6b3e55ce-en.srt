0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we have one more step, because up here, we

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
have just a poly.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And here we have a product of two of them,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so we want to make these comparable.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to use this formula for merging

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
for the product of two polys.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so we'll get one more phase, and that phase will be--

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
well, let me write it out.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we're going to get sigma g of v plus g of w

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
all in the exponent.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000


12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We get a phase that looks like g of v transposed 0, I, 0, 0,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
g of w, and then we have plus all the other phases

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we had from before.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So plus v tranposed 0, I, 0, 0, plus f of v plus f of w.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000


17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So what have we done?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We started with this expression, u sigma v plus w u dagger,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and by expanding it in two different ways,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we got two different expressions that look like minus 1

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to the something times a poly.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now, we can equate those and find some non-trivial relations

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
of g and f.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, why don't we start with the equation for the poly?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The equation for the phase looks pretty hairy.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So the equation for the polys is pretty simple.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's just g of v plus w equals g of v plus g of w.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000


29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So here we have g of v plus g of w.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Up there, we have g of v plus w.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I said before that g was an arbitrary function ,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
as far as we knew, that took bit strings of length 2n--

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or sorry, elements of f2 to the 2n

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and mapped them to other elements of f2 to the 2n.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now we know a lot more.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now we know it's a linear function.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this implies that g of v is equal to Mv for some matrix

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
M. That's 2n by 2n dimensional.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This equation here means that g is a linear function,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and linear functions of vectors, that just means

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
doing a matrix vector multiply.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000


43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So that nails down significantly the structure

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of what these Cliffords do.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000


46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So any questions about that?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000


48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For the phase, it's a little hairier,

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and we can see we have similar terms.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We had f of v plus w, f of v plus f of w.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So we can write that down.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So we can say f of v plus w equals f of v plus f of w.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So far so good.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But then there's some more terms.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then there's plus this term, this term.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000


57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And this can also help nail down the structure of f.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a little more complicated and I

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
don't want to fully work it out, so I'm just

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
going to give you, say, at a high level, what you get.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Basically, f is not just linear, because it has these kind

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of quadratic terms also.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So this part looks like what you get from a linear function

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and this part looks like what you

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
get from a quadratic function.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And the only nice thing to say about it is,

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
whereas for g, it was linear, and what

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that linear function was we had almost total freedom.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll see a little bit that freedom is restricted,

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
mostly any matrix goes.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Here, the quadratic part is totally determined by g,

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
whereas the linear part, we have a lot of freedom.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So it turns out, and I'm not going

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
to fully drive this, that f of v is some quadratic function of v

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that depends on g.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So in other words, once you've chosen g,

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you've also basically chosen the quadratic part of f.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But then you have some additional freedom.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You have plus some linear function

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
of v, which is more or less arbitrary.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
