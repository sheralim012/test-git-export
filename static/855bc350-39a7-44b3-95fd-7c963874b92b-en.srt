1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me begin by reminding you about the Schatten p-norms.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Given a matrix, X, the singular value decomposition--

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
there are a few different ways we can write it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They are all kind of equivalent.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The one I want to use is to write

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that if X is U sigma V dagger where U and V are

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:40,000
isometries and sigma is a square diagonal matrix, where

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the sigma i are non-negative numbers, non-negative reals.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So with this decomposition--

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000


11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and if you haven't seen the proof of it

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
before, you can prove it, once you believe

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the spectral theorem, you can prove it

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
by doing the spectral decomposition of X dagger X.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So given this, we can define a norm on X to be--

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000


17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So the Schatten p-norm of X is the lp norm

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of this vector of singular value, sigma 1 through sigma n.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In other words, the sum from i equals 1 to n,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
sigma i to the p, to the 1 over p.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Last time I mentioned that a norm

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
should have various properties, like if you rescale X

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
by a scalar the norm should rescale.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That shouldn't be too hard to see here.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If the norm is zero that can only be because the matrix

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
was zero.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That also shouldn't be too hard to see.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The triangle inequality is a little less obvious.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to prove that here.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But that is a non-trivial fact you'd

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
have to establish to show this is a norm.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000


33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I ask you to take my word for that.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Instead I'm going to talk about the application to the object

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that we studied.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So if X is a positive semi-definite matrix then

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the singular values of X are just the eigenvalues of X.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And so in that case the Schatten one norm is just

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the sum of the eigenvalues.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000


41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Meaning trace X. So I've just found

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
kind of a roundabout way of describing the trace.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the Schatten one norm, you could say,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is an indirect way of describing the trace

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
of a positive semi-definite matrix.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So if I want to say that Rho is a density matrix,

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
an equivalent way of saying that is that Rho is positive

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
semi-definite and has a Schatten one norm equal to one.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000


50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you could say that the--

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
this you could call the unit sphere

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
in the Schatten one norm.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So it's hard to draw the unit sphere for the Schatten norms,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but I'll just describe them for the lp norms.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So the unit sphere means a set of points that has norm one.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So for l2 it's just the usual circle.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK, this is in two dimensions.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We call it a sphere, but in two dimensions it's a circle.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So the l1 norm, it's the things whose absolute values add up

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to one.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So that would be this little diamond inside the circle.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So the l infinity norm, it's the largest entry of the matrix--

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry, of the vector, after we take the absolute value.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So that's going to look like this square

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
on the outside of the circle.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So these are a few of the unit spheres in the lp norms.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They're just the vectors with norm one

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
according to whatever norm we're using to measure.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OK?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So the unit sphere in s1, if we take

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the positive semi-definite part of that,

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
gives us density matrices.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000


74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
By the way, as a--

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to see why this is--

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you can think of this as natural,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
what is the analog for probability distributions?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So probability distributions are vectors that are non-negative.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And they correspond to the unit sphere of which norm?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The l1 norm, exactly.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So probability distributions, their vectors are non-negative

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and they sum to one.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So taking the absolute value does nothing.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I could say that either they sum to one

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
or the sum of the absolute values of them sum to one.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The sum of the absolute values is the one norm,

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when I set p equal to one here.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So when we go from probability distributions

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
to density matrices we go from a vector

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
with non-negative entries to a positive semi-definite matrix.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We go from the l1 norm to the Schatten norm.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So it's really-- you know, this is

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
why it is sort of like the matrix version of the l1 norm.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
