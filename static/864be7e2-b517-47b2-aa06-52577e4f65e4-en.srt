0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me use this as the definition.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So definition one of quantum operations

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is a composition of unitaries, adding

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a system, and partial trace.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000


6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So this is a reasonable definition.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is what I call an operational definition

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because it's intuitive what is allowed in this system.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But it's pretty complicated because these two can change

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
dimension, and I'm allowed any arbitrary composition

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of any number of these maps.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
To say what belongs to this set seems very complicated.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's try and simplify it, now, a little bit.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, actually, before I simplify,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
any questions about this set of operations?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000


17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So to simplify it, I want to introduce one

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
more mathematical object, which is

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
a generalization of unitaries called an isometry.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000


21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
An isometry is a map--

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
let's call it V--

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000


24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
from A dimensions to B dimensions--

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
sorry-- from system phase A to system B

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
where the dimensions are dA and dB,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and the output dimension should be at least as large

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
as the input dimension.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And it has the property that V dagger

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
V is equal to the identity on system A.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What this means-- this is equivalent to saying

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that it preserves length.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So in other words, the norm of an input, psi,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is equal for any vector in the input space,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the norm of the output is equal to the norm of the input.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this is one where the name really

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
describes it pretty well.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
"Iso" means same.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
"Metry" is like metric--

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
like length.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So "isometry" really just means same length.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This looks a lot like unitaries, but for unitaries

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you also have the property that V V dagger is

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
equal to the identity.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And here, V V dagger is equal to identity

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
if and only if the dimensions are equal.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So if the dimensions are equal, these are just unitary maps,

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
but I've expanded them to allow the possibility of increasing

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the dimension.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000


51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it's perfectly possible to increase

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the dimension of something and preserve all the lengths.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example, take this sheet of paper.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I describe a vector on it by a two-dimensional vector.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can embed this into three-dimensional space,

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and, now, that embedding maps 2D vectors to 3D vectors,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and it certainly preserves their length, but it's not unitary.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've increased the dimension.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000


60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So that's one example of an isometry.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Another one, which is the classic one

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
for quantum channels--

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000


64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and you'll see, now, why this is relevant--

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000


66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
is to tensor on another system.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000


68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So suppose that the output has twice the dimension

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
of the input, then we could tensor on another qubit

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and initialize that qubit into the zero state.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000


72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is an isometry.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If I start with a unit vector, the output

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is still a unit vector.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But it's not a unitary because it's not even a square matrix.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a rectangular matrix.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It increases dimension, and it's one of these maps.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is one of these adding system maps.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And so we can see that isometries include,

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
basically, parts a and b here--

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000


82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
in other words, performing unitaries

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and adding new systems in a pure state.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000


85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And they have the nice property that they

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
are closed under composition.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So we knew this for unitaries.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If I do one unitary map, then another unitary map,

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
their product is also unitary.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Same is true for isometry.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's acting with-- one isometry preserves length,

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and then a second one also preserves length,

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
then their product preserves length as well.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So if I compose isometries, I get another isometry.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And so isometries are a set of operations that include a and b

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and are closed under composition.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I've gone a long way to classifying what these quantum

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
operations are.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000


100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sweeping one little detail under the rug here, which is--

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it looks, here, like I'm only adding pure states.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I've said, maybe I could even

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
add a system in a mixed state-- sigma.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000


105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not going to address that, but you

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
can come back to it later after we include the partial trace.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000


108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Any other questions about isometries

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
or how they address part of what a quantum operation does?

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000


111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So let me add, actually, that they--

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000


113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
this is how they act on pure states.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000


115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let me add that for density matrices,

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you write them down the same way that you would the unitaries.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Rho gets mapped to V rho V dagger.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000


119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So for this example here, where psi is mapped to psi tensor 0,

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we have V rho V dagger is equal to rho tensor ket 0 bra 0.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
