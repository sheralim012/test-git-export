00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So in general I said that C with an image

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of the generator matrix.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can also define to be the kernel of this other matrix, H,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which is called the check matrix.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So G, let me just write the dimensions.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
G is n by k.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
H is n by n minus k.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000


9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And the generator, if you think of it as I--

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this kind of corresponds to my encoding map.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The check matrix does not directly

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
give me my decoding map, but it's something

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in the direction of decoding.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It says I take my string.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I multiply it by the check matrix.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I just get out zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know I'm in the code.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If I get out something non-zero I know I'm not in the code.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now decoding can still be hard.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In fact, in general it's np hard.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And there's a cryptosystem, the McEliece cryptosystem,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
based on this hardness of decoding linear codes.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So it's-- this does not take you all the way home-- far from it.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But it tells you--

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it takes you in the direction of decoding.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And a lot of decoding schemes start

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
by applying a check matrix and then looking at the string

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that you get.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The string, by the way, is called the syndrome,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
because it sort of is, you know, it's

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
like the disease is the error.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And you don't get to see it directly.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You get to diagnose it via the syndrome.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And the syndrome is I failed some of those checks.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I should have x3 equals x4.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I violate a parity check.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
