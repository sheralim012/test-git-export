1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's see what quantum error correction in the Steinspring

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
picture looks like.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose I have some state and system Q.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And it experiences this noise map N. Then the way

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we can think about this noise happening in a pure state

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
picture--

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
remember, we can think of the channel

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
as an isometry, followed by a partial trace.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And so, if we just don't do the partial trace,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
think in our mind, there's an environment system

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that we're never going to touch again,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but I'm not going to mathematically carry out

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the partial trace.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then I just have an isometry.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And so what the noise does is it maps me to a sum over i,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
E_i psi, on system Q, and the label I on the environment.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Think of E as an environment which is inaccessible.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If I trace it out, I get back the action

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of the quantum channel.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm never going to touch it again.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But I don't need to carry out a partial trace.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm within my rights to describe this as a pure state.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is that church of the larger Hilbert space

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
perspective I mentioned before.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Without loss of generality, I can describe things

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as a pure state.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000


28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So now, let me do the same thing for--

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000


30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
let's say the decoding map.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let's suppose this has some Kraus operators as well.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's say it as Kraus operators D_j.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So then I'll map to sum over i, j, D_j E_i psi, that we keep

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
around this label I from the environment, and J,

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from another system R, which is the one we have in the recovery

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
map.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So our recovery map is also a quantum operation.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Going to discard some information.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is a system under our control.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So we could, if we wanted to, measure it

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
before discarding it.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Or not.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We could just discard it.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The recovery map should work--

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
it's designed to work if we just discard it.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So this is the full state, but imagine

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that we're never going to touch these two systems again--

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Q and R. Sorry, E and R, we're going

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to just throw in the garbage.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And we're going to be left with system Q.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So if we've done this and this recovery map works,

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:02,000
then this should equal psi tensor some other state gamma,

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
on systems E and R. This is if the decoding works.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then we should have recovered back our original state.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And the system that we don't want, they're in some state

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that we don't care about.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're not entangled with the state of interest.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So what that means is that applying any Kraus operator

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
from the noise--

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
any Kraus operator from the decoding

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
give us something proportional to our original state.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, proportional could mean zero.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So it could mean these noise take you

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
all over the place and the decoding map

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
contains many Kraus operators, some of which

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
will act given a given noise--

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
some of them will apply given to a particular noise operation.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Some of them will not.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
For a Kraus operator to not apply,

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that's kind of like the state being mapped to zero.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But it should at least be proportional.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So zero or this time some nonzero scalar.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And this should be true for all i and j.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000


75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So that's just another way of saying what successful decoding

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
looks like.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000


78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And there's one-- this is very general.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I said almost nothing about the particular code,

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
about what the nature of the decoding

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
map other than that's a quantum operation.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The nature of the noise, other than it's a quantum operation.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But already there's one consequence

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you immediately get from this.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Which is something I said before but didn't justify.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I said, it's nice to have this property,

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
but I didn't justify why we should have this property.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So the consequence we get--

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000


90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
actually, does anyone see a nice consequence of this?

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Maybe there are others I haven't thought of.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The fact that successful decoding

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
gives you this condition?

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Does that suggest anything good?

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000


96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The one that I think comes out of this that's nice

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is if I take a linear combination of two

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
different E_i's that satisfies this condition,

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
they're also going to satisfy this condition.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right?

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If I have E_i and E_i prime, and they both

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
have the property that D_j E_i or E_i prime times psi

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is proportional to psi for all choices of j, then

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
their linear combinations will also have that property.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And so what that means is that S is a linear subspace.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If I can correct two different Kraus operators,

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
then I can also correct linear combinations of them.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
