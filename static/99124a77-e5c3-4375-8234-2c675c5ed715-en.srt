00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Once you've defined the stabilizer group,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
s, to understand which errors are detected by it,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you should do that in terms of the normalizer group.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, N of s, recall is the set of polys such that--

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000


6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
well, one way of writing it is that p s p dagger

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is equal to s, as a sort of set-wise operation.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So this means that if I take this set, s,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I multiply every element in it

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
by p on the left and p dagger on the right,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I get back the original set, s.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000


13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now-- and so I'm looking at all polys, p,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that have this property.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, polys, remember-- they either commute or anti-commute.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, if I have anything in s that anti-commutes with p,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to get back negative of that element.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And, you remember, the stabilizer groups

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
do not contain negative identity.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So that means, if they contain some element,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
they do not contain the negation of that element.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, if I contain, you know, g, I do not also contain minus g.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this is equivalent--

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so this statement right here is the equivalent

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
of saying that p g equals g p, for all g in the stabilizer

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
group.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
OK?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's just another way of saying that I

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
want the set of polys that commutes with everything

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in the stabilizer group.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000


32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And because a stabilizer group is Abelian,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the normalizer always contains a stabilizer group.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But there can be more things in it as well.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000


36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, for this group, there are two more elements

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that we can add.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And one way to see them is, if you

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
remember this linear algebra point of view--

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000


41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so let me write l of s to be a subspace of f2 to 5--

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean, the-- this means the linear subspace corresponding

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to s.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And in that case, l of n of s is just the orthogonal complement

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of l of s.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Remember, last time we defined the symplectic inner product.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And we said that the polys commute

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
if their corresponding vectors are orthogonal--

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
have inner product zero.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So the set of all polys that commute with everything in s--

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
when you translate into vector language,

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you're saying, take all the vectors corresponding to s

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and ask for the set of things which is perpendicular to that.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And so that's, basically, what this perp symbol means.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It means take a subspace.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Take everything perpendicular to that.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is probably a good time to mention

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that, when I said that F2 was a field,

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and you can do linear algebra over it,

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
most of what you learned about linear algebra

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
for the reals and complex numbers will carry over.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But there's a few little oddities.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
One of them is that you can have a non-zero vector which

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is orthogonal to itself.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In fact, s is an entire subspace full of vectors that are all

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
orthogonal to themselves--

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
well, in fact, to each other.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Everything in the subspace is orthogonal to everything else

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in the subspace, because this is an Abelian group.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So that's just a little oddity to keep

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
in mind about F2 linear algebra, which is not present,

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
of course, in the reals and complex numbers.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OK, so how can we find this subspace?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The hint is that it's orthogonal to these vectors.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, basically, you want something which,

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if you look at the inner product of--

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000


78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
wherever there are x's, compare wherever the new vector is,

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
where there are x's.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Look at the corresponding z's, here, and they should--

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that number of overlaps, plus the number

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of overlaps of the z's in the new word with x's here--

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that should be even.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And so you could do this just by doing F2 linear algebra.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Or you could just--

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I could just tell you a vector.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And you can verify that it works.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And so, to do it the quick way, I'll

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
tell you that one vector that's in it is the 5x operator.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So if I take a string of all x's, you

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
can see, for every one of these cyclically shifted codewords,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it's going to commute with the x's in it.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And there are two z's.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, two z's means inner product of zero.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
1 plus 1 here is 0.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And the same logic would apply to the 5z operator.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, for the same reason, the 5z operator is in n of s.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And these are not members of s, because, however I multiply

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
these together, I'm going to have an even number

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
of x's and z's.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And these have an odd number.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I can write n of s as being generated

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
by the stabilizers, plus these two additional operators.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000


105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And these operators-- so what do they do?

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They commute with everything in the stabilizer set,

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
which means that they map this subspace to itself.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, if I take one of these operators,

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and I act on this subspace, I'm going

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to map it back to the subspace.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But that doesn't mean that I fix every single vector in it,

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
right.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So the stabilizers fix every single vector in this subspace.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Any vector you have here, the stabilizers will act trivially.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But these things-- all we know about those is, they leave you

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
within the subspace.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
In general, they will change the vectors within the subspace.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And so we can define--

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so, I haven't told you what zero bar and one bar are.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We can just define them to be eigenstates of these operators.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So let me call this--

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000


123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
sorry, let me do it like this.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000


125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me define these operators to be z bar and x bar.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000


127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
These will be the operators that act on the logical qubit,

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
so x bar and z bar act on logical qubit.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Before we go on, we should note that they anti-commute, right,

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because they overlap in an odd number of places.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So they, really, in that sense, are

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
polys that look like x and z.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And, with these in hand, after having to find these,

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we can just choose zero bar and one bar to be the eigenstates--

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the plus or minus one eigenstates of z bar.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So we'll choose it so that zero bar zero is equal to zero--

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
sorry, z bar zero bar is equal to zero bar.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Z bar one bar is minus one bar.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000


140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And once we've defined them in this way,

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it follows that x bar has the action that we want.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000


143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, just knowing that x bar and z bar anti-commute,

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and knowing that zero bar and one bar

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
are the plus and minus eigenstates of z bar,

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it follows that we have this x action.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000


148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Does anyone-- can anyone see why that's true?

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000


150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
[INAUDIBLE]

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Right.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, you, basically, just write out

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the anti-commutation relations, and you'll see this happens.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And, I guess, we saw that last time, right.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We saw that, when you have something that's

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
a plus one eigenstate of a poly, and then

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you hit this with another poly, then

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
this first state will remain an eigenstate of the first poly.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But whether it's a plus one or minus eigenstate

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
may flip, depending on whether the second poly commutes

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
or anti-commutes.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So, if I were to hit this with something that

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
commuted with z bar, I would not change whether it's

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a plus or minus one eigenstate.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If I hit it with something that anti-commutes,

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will flip it from a plus one to a minus one

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
eigenstate, and vice versa.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And the way we label these plus and minus eigenstates

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
are zero bar and one bar.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, technically, actually, I have a little bit of--

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have a phased degree of freedom.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So that leaves open the possibility

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that I put some phase in front of these.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But I can just use that phased degree of freedom

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to make sure that, here, there's no phase--

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you know, that I get these m instead of having any phases,

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
right.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Because just these equations up here

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
didn't fix the phase of these eigenstates.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But I can use that so that this equation becomes true.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
