1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One nice application of this is the trivial code.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So if S is a--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:20,000


4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If S is a stabilizer group, and remember

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that means it's a subgroup of the polys which does not

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
contain negative identity, which means that it's abelian,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then I claim that there exists U in the Clifford group,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
such that U S U dagger is the trivial code.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I gave most of the proof for that,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I mean the argument for it already,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which is simply that the generators of S

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and the generators of the trivial code

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
have the same commutation relations.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In other words, in the F2 picture

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
they have the same inner product.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or inner products.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They are pairs of inner products are the same.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And so that means that there exists

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a symplectic transformation that will take

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
these vectors to those vectors.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And then from the part that you'll show on the P

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
set that means that there exists a corresponding unitary that

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
will map the polys in the way that we want.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So you can see how this symplectic picture

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
