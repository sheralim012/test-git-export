0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll describe a third special case.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All this has been a little bit abstract with general D.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I think for cubits, you can make things a little bit more

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
concrete.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000


6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So in the case when d equals 2, we

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
can say a lot more about what density matrices are.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I'm going to slightly change the notation for the basis

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
state.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So if d is general, I like to refer to the states as 1, 2,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
through d.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When d is 2, I want to call the basis 0 and 1.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
OK?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Usually you can tell from context what's going on.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So what can we say about the qubit density matrix?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So we know that rho is Hermitian,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and that it's 2 by 2.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And so that really is going to restrict the number of degrees

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of freedom a lot, because there are just not

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that many different 2 by 2 matrices.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And in fact, the space of Hermitian--

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
well in general, of Hermitian d by d matrices--

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is just a d squared dimensional real vector space.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So for 2 by 2, that's four dimensional.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And so I can write RHO as some linear combination

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of four different matrices.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And one very common choice are the Pauli matrices, generalized

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to include identity.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So let me write a0 times identity plus a1 sigma one

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
a2 sigma 2 plus a3 sigma 3.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And these a's are just arbitrary real numbers.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So nothing stops me from changing my convention slightly

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and dividing it all by 2.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You'll see in a minute why that makes it a little bit more

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
convenient.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000


37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And, just to remind you, these Pauli matrices--

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:36,000
sigma 1 is sigma x, sigma 2 is sigma y, sigma 3 is sigma z.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And this i, you could also think of as sigma 0.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK, so, so far I've just used the fact

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that it's Hermitian to write it in this form.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But we have more information that we can

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
use to narrow down what rho is.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000


45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we know that the trace of rho is equal to 1.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What can you say about the trace of the Pauli matrices?

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They're all zero.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So when you evaluate the trace of the right hand side,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the a1 a2 a3 go away.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's trace of the identity?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
2 divided by 2, so maybe you can see a little but why

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the normalization is helpful.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we're left just with a0.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000


55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So we've learned, since trace rho

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is 1, that tells us that is a0 is equal to 1.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000


58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So let me rewrite rho here.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So rho is identity plus sum from i equals 1 to 3

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
a i sigma i over 2.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000


62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So we still don't know anything about the a1 a2 a3.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000


64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But there's one condition we haven't used--

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm about to erase it.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's the positive sum indefinite condition.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000


68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And as often happens with the PSD condition,

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
there are three equivalent ways you can use it, right?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There is this quadratic form way--

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that doesn't seem so helpful.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's writing rho as a dagger times a--

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
doesn't seem so helpful.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then there's the eigenvalue way.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Usually, one of these is good, and the others are not so good.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In this case, the eigenvalues are the helpful way

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to look at it.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So let's calculate the eigenvalues of rho.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000


80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There's actually a nice calculation

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
which I'm going to skip, so I'm going

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to assume that you've seen it before.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you haven't seen it before--

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
nothing depends on this type of calculation,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
so you can just trust me for the answer.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But derive it in the privacy of your own home later on.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What are the eigenvalues?

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well actually, sorry-- let me write it like this.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The eigenvalues of just the traceless part, sum over i 1

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
through 3 of a i sigma i so it's a 2 by 2 matrix.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's traceless, so the eigenvalues sum up to 0.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So it's plus or minus something.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And it turns out to be plus or minus sum of the a i

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
squared, square root.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000


96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So in other words, take the Euclidean length

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
of the vector of a's, and that tells you the eigenvectors.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So when we take the eigenvectors of rho,

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it's just going to be 1 plus or minus this number.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000


101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And let me just abbreviate it as the norm

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
of the vector a divided by 2.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000


104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So those are the two eigenvalues--

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
1 plus the norm, 1 minus the norm, all over 2.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And the reason we're asking about the eigenvalues

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is because we want to know if rho is positive semidefinite.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So these are greater than or equal to zero,

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
since rho is PSD.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The plus branch of the plus or minus

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is always greater or equal is 0, but the minus gives us

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
a non-trivial constraint.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is equivalent to demanding that the norm of a be less than

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or equal to 1.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so this gives us, now, necessary and sufficient

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
conditions for rho to be a qubit density matrix.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So just to summarize, rho is a valid density matrix

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
if and only if rho is i plus--

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
let me write this as a dot sigma over 2,

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
with the norm of a less than or equal to 1.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
