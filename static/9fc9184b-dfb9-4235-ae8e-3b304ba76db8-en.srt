00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Before I mention the properties, let

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
me introduce another stabilizer-related notion,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is a stabilizer subspace.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000


5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the stabilizer subspace, V sub S

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is the set of simultaneous plus 1 eigenvalues of all

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of the elements of S. So the set of psi,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
such that g psi is equal to psi for all g in S. OK,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so we saw a bit of this in the last lecture.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We have these codes where you could define them--

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we saw it, you know, for a classical linear code--

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you could define them as the simultaneous

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
plus 1 eigenspace of a bunch of commuting products of Pauli z

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
operators.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now I'm going to generalize this.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to say let S be any subgroup of the Paulis.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And let me define the corresponding subspace V sub

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
S to be the simultaneous plus 1 eigenspace of all

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
of these Paulis.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
OK?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000


22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And in math notation or in math, usually the term stabilizer

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
means the set of group elements that

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
acts trivially on all of the elements of some space.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So you would start with V. And you

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
would say that S is the stabilizer of that.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And it usually means something much more general than being

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a subgroup of Paulis.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
However, in quantum information, when we say stabilizer,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we generally mean just a subgroup of Paulis.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I'm going to use stabilizer always in that setting.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But you should be aware that in math, people

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
use it in a different-- a more general way.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So this is a general way of describing codes,

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
or, even more generally, a large class

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of quantum states and subspaces.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And they can be defined for any subgroup S.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
However, to make it interesting, we often

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
want to impose certain conditions.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So we usually will require that S does not

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
contain minus the identity.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
S will always contain the identity.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We don't want it to contain minus the identity.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can anyone see what the problem would

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
be if we allowed S to contain minus the identity?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So right.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So no non-zero vector would satisfy it.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If minus I were an S, the subspace

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
would be only the 0 vector.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mathematically well-defined, but not interesting.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So we exclude this case.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now, you get an interesting consequence of this.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because we're talking about the Pauli matrices.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So there are a number of really nice things about the Pauli

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
matrices.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So if you have two Pauli matrices,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
then sometimes they commute.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And when I say Pauli matrix, I actually

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
mean something of this form-- a tensor product

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
of the single qubit Pauli matrices.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to use Pauli matrices to also include the n qubit

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
version.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The n qubit version, like the 1 qubit version,

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:37,000
have the property that the product of two Pauli matrices,

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
basically, they either commute or anti-commute.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So gh is either hg or minus hg.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is not true in general.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It is a particular fact of Pauli matrices.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000


70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And we get a lot of leverage out of this.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So one thing that we get from this is

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
suppose we have two elements of S that don't commute--

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
so gh not equal to hg.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then that means that gh is equal to minus hg.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Right?

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because that's the only other option.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And because S is a group, if I multiply gh times gh,

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that will also be an element of the group.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I can replace the second gh with minus hg.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I get minus ghhg.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000


82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But g and h are Pauli, so they each square to identity.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So h squared is equal to identity.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
g squared is equal to identity.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I'm left with minus identity.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So if I start with any pair that belongs to S, and anti-commute

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
or even fail to commute, then I have that minus identity

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
belongs in S. So just imposing this requirement

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that minus identity's not contained in S,

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
we obtain that S is abelian.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In other words, everything in S commutes.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
