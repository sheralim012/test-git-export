00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's look at a quantum code and use

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
that as an example to illustrate some

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of these ideas and definitions.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000


5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Remember the quantum bit flip code.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So now in order to understand the code let's

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
first look at the noise model.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What I just erased here was the classical noise model

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of the binary symmetric channel.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the quantum case, what we have

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is a map that says that some input density

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
matrix goes to sum output density matrix e of row.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is a notation that's commonly

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
used in the community, which I'll

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
start to use today, which was with some probability 1 minus p

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the original density matrix that comes in.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can think of this as a pure state if you wish.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With some probability 1 minus p nothing happens to the state.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But I'll have a stochastic combination.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So with probability p, I'll have some error.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And in this case, the error is x row x.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And remember, we conjugate.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We put the unitary operation on both sides of a density matrix.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If this were a pure state, this would

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
be something like psi psi, and then it

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
would have u and u dagger on either side like this.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So think of that as you see a term which describes an error.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not going to describe in formal ways

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
all the ways that a density matrix can involve,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but this is the noise model.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this is called the bit flip channel.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000


33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we encoded a single qubit for this code

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
where we defined the logical 0 as being

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
three zeros and the logical 1 as being three ones.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000


37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So another thing that's useful to keep in mind

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
is the picture behind this.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What we have is two parties that are trying to communicate.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And these are probably the two most famous people

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in the field after Peter Shore, Alice and Bob.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So Alice had some state row.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And she's communicating with Bob over a channel

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which I'll call e or epsilon.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And Bob receives e of row like this.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So that's the physical picture behind what I'm drawing.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Right.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And Bob wants to be able to recover the information

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that Alice has sent, despite what Eve might do.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Eve being the environment that's causing the errors,

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
otherwise known as e or epsilon in this diagram.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So Eve is probably the fourth most famous person

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in quantum information.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The way we're doing this can be defined

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
in a much more formal way by giving you

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
an analogous definition to the classical codes,

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but for quantum codes.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So let me define that for you.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A quantum code with parameters n, k, and d.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Excuse me.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to leave out distances for now.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So a quantum n, k code--

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and the convention in the community

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is to use double brackets for quantum

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
codes versus single brackets for classical codes--

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is defined as a k qubit subspace of an n qubit Hilbert space.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000


68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Period.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000


70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's no more to the definition.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That is, it's just some subspace of a Hilbert space.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just like for classical codes I told you

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the classical code was a set of bit strings.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, OK, it's a subspace instead of just a set of vectors.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But the set of vectors happens to be orthonormal to each other

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and defines a Hilbert subspace.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So the reason I've left out distances and so forth

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
is because they're a little hard to define

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
until I give you the analogous quantity to a Hamming weight

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and Hamming distance.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I'm not going to do that in this class.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But you can rest assure that it does exist

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and is a very powerful thing in the field.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So let's get an example.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000


86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Again, 0 0 0 and 1 1 1 is the logical codewords.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Here are k equals 1, n equals 3.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, compare this with what you might

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
do if you are a classical coding theorist in 1995.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You might have said if Alice has stated

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that she wants to transmit row, then

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
she should transmit psi, psi, psi.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000


94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why can't she do that?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, if she doesn't know how to produce psi

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but she was just giving it, then, first of all,

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
she has no way to clone that unknown state

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to get three copies of it.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Secondly, you'll find that even if you did create it and send

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it across like this, you can't measure that state to find out

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
what errors occurred on it.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So although we showed you how this works,

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
there is an enormous conceptual leap

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that went to creating this instead of that

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that I want you to appreciate.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And this is not how quantum codes work.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is how quantum codes work.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is the obvious way to make quantum codes

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that we've just forgotten about because it doesn't work.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And there is something very non-intuitive about doing it

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
this way until you get your mind rearranged like a quantum

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
