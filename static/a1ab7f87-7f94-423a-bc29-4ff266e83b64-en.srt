0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So what happens if you apply 1, 0, 0 e to the i theta

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to one of these qubits.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's say 2 qubit 2.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000


5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
OK.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000


7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, 0 goes to 1/2, 0, 0, 0 plus 0, 1, 1 plus e

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to the i theta 0, 1, 1 plus 1, 0, 1 plus e to the i

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
theta 1, 1, 0.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
1 goes to 1/2, 0, 0, 0.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000


12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not doing this right.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
0, 0, 1 plus e to the i theta 0, 1, 0 plus 1,

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
0, 0 plus e to the i theta 1, 1, 1.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000


16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So now, what we want to do is we want

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to project these states onto 0, logical 0,

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
logical 1 and logical--

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000


20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OK, so we made the phase error on the second qubit.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So let's call this sigma z on a second qubit, logical zero

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and sigma z on the second qubit, logical 1.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000


24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So these are the only things that

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
are going to get projected onto because--

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000


27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
we can-- suppose we try projecting this on to sigma z

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
error on the third qubit.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You would get 0, 0, 1 minus--

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
or rather you get minus 0, 0, 1 plus 1, 0, 0.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that's minus 1 plus 1.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And here you get e to the i theta minus e to the i theta.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this state is orthogonal to sigma z, 1, 0, 0l, et cetera.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000


35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it turns out that--

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000


37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
let's see.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How much time do I have?

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OK, I was going to do this projection.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But maybe I'll just skip this math

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and go on to the easy way of seeing this.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the easy way of seeing this is 1, 0, 0,

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
e to the i theta is equal to e to the i theta over 2, e

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to the minus i theta, 0, 0, e to the i theta is

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
equal to e to the i theta cos theta times

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I minus e to the i theta 2.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, these should have thetas over 2's on them.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sine theta over 2, sigma z because e to the i theta over 2

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is cos theta over 2 plus i sine theta over 2.

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I left out an i here.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000


52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So maybe it's useful doing this projection.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So let's project this state.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Project 1, e to the i theta on 2, sigma z on 2.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is on qubit 2.

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:07,000
2, a logical 1, which is 0, 0, 1 minus 0, 1, 0 plus 1,

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
0, 0 minus 1, 1, 1, to 1/2.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So what we're going to do is we're

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
going to take the inner product sigma z 2.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
OK, we really should be projecting onto a subspace.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So let's project it onto this subspace formed

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
by sigma z error on the second qubit of the original code

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
space.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So an error-correcting code is a subspace of Hilbert space.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So we'll project this onto the subspace

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you get by applying a sigma z to the second qubit.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So we get the projection 1/2 times 1/2--

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that's 1/4-- minus e to the i theta--

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
again, I guess we divide by 4--

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:24,000
plus 1/4 again minus e to the i theta over 4

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is equal to 1/4 times 1 minus e to the i theta over 2.

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:58,000


74
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now, if you project 1, e to the i theta,

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:23,000
0l onto the same subspace, you get the same amplitude except--

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000


77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
OK, I'm doing this wrong.

78
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is a sigma z 2 error applied to a 1.

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you project the small-phase error applied to a 0 onto

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the same subspace, you're going to get the same thing--

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
sigma z 2 error applied to 0.

82
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So basically that takes this and, with some probability,

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
projects it onto this subspace and, with the 1

84
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
minus that probability, projects it onto the correct space.

85
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And the reason this works is that you

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
can write this as that.

87
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And with this probability, when you apply this to that state,

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
gets projected onto the correct encoded qubit.

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And with this probability, it gets

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:03,000
projected onto the encoded qubit with 1 sigma z error

91
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
on the second qubit.

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000


93
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know.

94
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Was this too complicated?

95
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000


96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And the reason that works is that your actual error

97
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
can be expressed as e to the i theta over 2

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
cosine theta over 2 times no error minus this times

99
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
a sigma z error on the second qubit.

100
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000


101
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And then, when you measure it, the way the code works

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is that cos theta over 2 squared of the time.

103
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You will measure that there was no error.

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And when you do that, the code with the error

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
gets projected onto the no error subspace.

106
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And sine theta over 2 squared of the time,

107
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
you will measure that there was an error.

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And when you do that, its gets projected

109
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
onto the code subspace with an error on the second qubit.

110
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now you know which one it got projected onto.

111
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can fix the error on the second qubit.

112
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000


113
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
OK, so we can go back here.

114
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Any 2 by 2 matrix is alpha i times sigma times

115
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
i plus alpha x, sigma x plus alpha y, sigma y plus alpha

116
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
z, sigma z.

117
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So any 2 by 2 matrix can be expressed

118
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
as in the Pauli basis.

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So a sigma x error, a sigma y error, and a signal z error,

120
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:34,000
which means any error on one qubit is, I guess,

121
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
superpositioned of these.

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000


123
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And that means, if you can fix any error on a single qubit

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
of the flavor sigma x, sigma y, sigma z,

125
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you can fix any one-qubit error.

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:15,000
For example, measure qubit in 0, 1 basis.

127
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000


128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you measure 0, it corresponds to 1, 0, 0, 0.

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So that corresponds to projecting that qubit

130
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
onto the 0 qubit, which, of course, is equal to 1 1

131
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
plus 1/2, 1, minus 1.

132
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So if you measure a qubit and you

133
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
get 0, half the time, when you try to correct it,

134
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
you will get there was no error.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And the other half, you will get there was a sigma z error.

136
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And similarly, if you got 1, you would

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
get exactly the same thing.

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Half the time, you would get no error.

139
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And half the time, you would get the sigma z error.

140
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000


141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So that is how this quantum error correcting code

142
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
will protect against any error in a single qubit.

143
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000


144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Now, there are codes that protect

145
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
against t errors of the form sigma x, signal y, or sigma z.

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And those will protect against any error

147
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
on any subset of t qubits.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000


149
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And these codes are the ones that

150
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
can be used to transmit information reliably.

151
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,000
