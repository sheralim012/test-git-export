00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We want to talk about code transformations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So we want unitaries such that UP U dagger, if P is a poly,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then UP U dagger should also be a poly for all polys P.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so I'm interested in--

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I want to know about the set of these U's.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And this set is called the Clifford group.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So it's the set of U--

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can write this line a little more compactly--

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
as U Pn U dagger is contained in Pn.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So Pn is a set of polys.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If I conjugate them by U, I should

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
remain within the set of polys.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In fact, this conjugation does not destroy information.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I could replace this with an equal sign,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and it would mean the same thing.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000


17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the first thing I want to do is talk

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
about what's in the Cliffords.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then we'll talk about how they act on polys

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in this vector space language.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000


22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it clear what I mean by the definition of the Clifford

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
group?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000


25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OK, so let's try to find what the elements of it are.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000


27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The first thing as we start to populate it is we

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
can certainly put all of the polys inside of it,

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
because the polys form a group.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So if I have an element of the polys

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and I conjugate them by another poly,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I get back yet another poly.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So one easy thing I can put in it are the other polys.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But that's not all.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There are also non-polys that are

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in this group that nevertheless will map polys to polys.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000


38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So one example of this is the Hadamard gate.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So Hadamard-- assuming you've seen it in 8.370--

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is this matrix.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000


42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Actually, I used it earlier in the class, even.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So it has these properties.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I guess I'm not writing the dagger,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
because it's equal to its own dagger.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And so right away, we see that this maps polys to polys

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
when I conjugate.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So all of the Hadamards belong to the Clifford group.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So let me write H1 through Hn belong to the Clifford group,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
where Hi means Hadamard acting on the i-th position.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000


52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is a single qubit gate that's not a poly.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Nevertheless, it's in the Clifford group.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Another example is the phase gate.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So let me define S to be the square root of Z.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I guess, it's a little ambiguous what

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
square roots mean, but I'll take the one that looks like 1,

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
0, 0, i.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I claim--

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I could also write this as e to the i pi over 4 z--

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000


62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
or pi over 2?

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Pi over 4, yeah, pi over 4.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000


65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I claim that this is also in the Clifford group.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So why is that?

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, if you put a Z here, it's just

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
going to compute with that.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So you're going to get back the Z. Then it's definitely a poly.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What about if you put an X-- if you do SX S dagger?

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So here, these do not commute, and S is not a poly.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So they don't anti-commute either.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So if I try to move the S past the X,

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not going to just pick up a minus sign.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So you have to be a little bit careful here.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
However, if I write it in this way, then the z in the exponent

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
does pick up a minus sign.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I can write this as X e to the minus i pi over 4

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
z times S dagger, because as I move the e to the i

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
pi over 4 z past it, the z in the exponent

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
picks of a minus sign.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And so what's this equal to-- e to the minus i pi over 4 times

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
z?

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000


85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's equal to S dagger.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So this is equal to X S dagger S dagger.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's S dagger squared?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Z. So this equal to XZ belongs to the poly group.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, this argument can only really

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
rely on it being a square root.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So one gate which is useful in quantum computing

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is the T gate, which is the square root of S.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I'm going to define it to be 1, 0, 0, e to the i pi over 4.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There's a few different ways of defining it.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can vary the overall phase.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So this is e to the i--

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000


99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, that is--

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So this is e to the i pi over 8 times z.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And it turns out if you do TX T dagger,

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the same argument will give you X S dagger.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You move the T past this, it becomes T dagger.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And so this is not in the poly group.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So you can't just put any phase you like on the diagonal.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's really only specific values that will work.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000


108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And it turns out--

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this is not--

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know a very easy way of proving this, other than kind

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
of checking a lot of cases--

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that the single-qubit Cliffords--

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
actually, I guess it will follow from things

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that we'll show later.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But I don't know a totally self-contained way of doing it.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The single-qubit Cliffords, it turns out,

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
are generated by the polys, Hadamard, and the phase gate.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact, I didn't really need the polys in here,

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
because if I take S squared, I get Z. And with Z and H,

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can get back the--

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
can get X. So really, just Hadamard and S

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
are enough to generate the single-qubit Cliffords.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So these examples I've given, I claim

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that's all there is for first single qubits.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
