0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me begin with the five-qubit code.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is a five, one, three code, so it

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
takes five physical qubits, encodes one logical qubit,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and at a distance three, which means

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
it can correct an error on one qubit

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or two erasure errors-- so one arbitrary error or two

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
erasure errors.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You saw in the piece that four, one, three is impossible.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000


10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So no code of four qubits has this property.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Five-- and so then the fact that you can do it with five

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
means that five is the lowest number

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
for which this is possible.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000


15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let me describe the code.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So last time, we saw that we could define a code subspace--

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a subspace of, in this case, C32--

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
as being the set of vectors, which

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is stabilized by some set of polys.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In fact, some group of polys.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And that group of polys we can describe by just writing down

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
as generators.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So it gives you a pretty compact way

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of describing a subspace of this 32-dimensional space.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So let me write down the stabilizer generators.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000


27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
At first, I think they look a little bit like magic.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But as we get into the course of the proof,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you start to appreciate why they work this way.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000


31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So the first one is ZXXZI, and all of the later ones

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
are just cyclic shifts of this.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I'll write them below each other so you see.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The next one is I Z XXZ and then keep shifting

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Z I ZXX, X ZIZX, and that's it.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So there is a fifth cyclic shift.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me just write it below XXZIZ.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000


39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry for my bad board technique.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000


41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This fifth one, which I've kind of included for completeness.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Once you have the top four, this is already

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
contained in the group generated by it.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So why is that?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let me just multiply them all together.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So in the first column, I get Z times Z is identity, times

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
X gives me X. Second column--

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
XZZ again gives me X. XXXZ gives me Z and so on.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So each column-- if I just multiply these four together

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
in order, I get this fifth one.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So it's generated by the first four.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But if you want it to look a little more symmetric,

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you might use all five and have this one redundant generator.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000


55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So we have four independent generators,

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
which means one logical qubit.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In other words, the dimension if VS is the space stabilized

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
by V, it has dimension two.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000


60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
OK, this describes a code space.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We could write it as span of zero bar and one bar--

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the logical 0 and one qubits--

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
just because it's a two-dimensional space.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can always describe it in that way.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not actually going to write these down

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because I think if I just write down

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
these things in terms of superpositions,

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
it would not be very illuminating.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I just want to point out that because it's a two-dimensional

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
space, of course, there's a basis like this--

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
a basis of two vectors.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I can just call one of them logical zero and logical one.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you can think of that is how I encode a zero and a qubit

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
into this code.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
