00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I want to mention a few special cases of density matrices.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000


3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I claim that they generalize both quantum states

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and probability distributions.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I want to just briefly justify that.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, one, pure states.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Two, probability distributions.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000


9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And, third, I want to talk about the special case of qubits.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because even though saying trace one and positive semidefinite,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think, is helpful, it's way easier

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
than thinking about it as there exists some ensemble.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The case of qubits is yet simpler,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that's one where you can really

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
visualize it and, I think, get some geometric intuition

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for the space of density matrices.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So let me talk about these now.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Maybe I'll leave up--

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000


20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
well, no, I'll erase this slide.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000


22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll leave up only the URL.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can get everything else from there.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:36,000


25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So-- OK.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So why do density matrices generalize both of these?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's talk first about pure states.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I said that a pure state is one where you--

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
in the deterministic column, that

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
means you know what the quantum state is.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And when you first learn quantum mechanics,

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this is almost implicit.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Right.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We talk about this-- the state of a harmonic oscillator,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you don't consider the possibility

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you might not know the state.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So if you know the state, you can

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
think of that as an ensemble where

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
there's just one item that has probability of one.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe some other things have probability zero.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But the distribution just looks like P1 is equal to one.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Si one is equal to some state Si.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And so RHO is equal to one.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, I won't write the one.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's just the outer product of Si with itself.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OK.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So it's just another way of writing in the pure state,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I write ket si bra si, instead of si by itself.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You might think this is a slightly wasteful way

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of writing out a state, of writing down d square numbers

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
instead of d, but it has some nice properties.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Besides the fact that it generalizes to--

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to other mixed density matrices where you don't exactly

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
know the state, it also gets rid of that annoying phase problem

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that we always had with quantum states.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So we always had a phase ambiguity

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that si is equivalent to e to the i thi si.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
These are mathematically different objects,

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but they describe the same quantum state.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, all measurements come out the same,

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
we treat them as physically the same object.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And here we see they correspond to the same density matrix,

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
right?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because this e to the i fi corresponds

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
to e to the i fi si e to the minus i fi bra si,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and the phases cancel out.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And so this object is, in some ways,

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
nice because it gets rid of that phase ambiguity.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it turns out this is generally true.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The degrees of freedom in the density matrix

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
are all physically observable.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If two density matrices are different,

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
there is a way to tell them apart.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that's, in a sense, a sharper correspondence

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
between the mathematical and the physical objects.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
