0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A syndrome is the pattern of measurement results

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
from, in the linear code case, the parity-check matrix.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And it then told you what the error actually

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is, after you do some extra reverse engineering,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or mapping, from that information

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
back to what the error was.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So that was H times E, for the linear codes.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For error correction overall, so I'll

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
add a little bit of discussion about the recovery operator,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
here.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000


11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are two steps.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The first step is that measurement of the syndrome.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000


14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The second step is to apply the corresponding recovery

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
operator, which takes the syndrome value,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
gives you back the error-free state that you hope was

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the one that was transmitted.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And that's error correction.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There are no more steps in it than these two.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And so, when I give you the criteria for error correction,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will try to evidence for you these two steps constructively,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
given a code and a set of errors.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And, to illustrate that, let's go through a quick example.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000


25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Recall the 3-bit bit-flip code, where we encoded a state

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as a 0000 plus b 111.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What we're going to do is to apply this syndrome measurement

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
circuit or operator measurement circuit using

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the following operators.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we'll define these as the syndrome operators

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
for that code.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000


33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The first of these is that Z1, Z2.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
These are poly operators on qubits one and two,

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
ordering the qubits from the left to the right.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But, if you will, another way of writing this

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is Z tensored Z tensored I qubit one, two, and three.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But, in this community, we try to be maximally lazy,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and so we drop as much extra notation as possible--

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
or "suppress" it, as people say in high-energy physics.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so we'll just write Z Z I. OK?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, by the way, be careful in this field.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
People also go so far as dropping all the [INAUDIBLE]

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the [INAUDIBLE] and just writing down

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the numbers instead.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And so sometimes I'll drop into that habit.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But this is very common.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A string of letters that look like this

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is actually the tensor product of Pauli matrices.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sometimes it's more convenient to label them with numbers.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
U2 will be Z2Z3.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000


53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And this is, again, I tensored Z tensored Z, or IZZ.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000


55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I claim that, if you measure these two

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
operators on that code, it will tell you enough information

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to decode what the error is and thus construct an error

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
correction code procedure.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So let me do that by giving you a table.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So here's Bob's state after the channel.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's that bit-flip channel which was on the board

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
right here before I erased it.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And we have, for example, the case of no error.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000


65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
With what probability does that happen,

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
if we have the bit-flip channel?

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Remember that the bit-flip channel was, with probability 1

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
minus p, nothing happens.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
With probability p, you get a bit flip.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000


71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So what is the probability of having nothing happen?

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000


73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
1 minus p cubed?

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, thank you.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
1 minus p cubed.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000


77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then let us imagine that we measure U1 and then U2.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the reason I can measure U1 and U2 both is not entirely obvious

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but is very important to think about for a moment.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Any suggestions?

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After all, if you measure a quantum state,

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
normally you can't measure something else subsequent to it

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
or switch the order of the two measurements,

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because measurements change states.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But here I claim it actually does not

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
matter which order I measure these two operators in.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000


89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In blue?

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Because they commute.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They commute.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, so any two operators, measurement operators,

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
which commute, you don't care about what order

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
they're measured in.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And these are deliberately chosen so that they do commute.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I'll measure U1 first, and I'll measure U2 second.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I'd like you to tell me what those measurement results are.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And remember, this is the Z variable

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that shows up in that top qubit, over here.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And there's a--

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can work it out by going through this circuit

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and throwing the state in, but there's an easy way

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to see what the measurement result is,

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
remembering that all we want to know

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
is whether the state is a plus-1 or a minus-1 eigenstate

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
of the unitary operator U. So if you will apply ZZI

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to this state coming in, does it stay unchanged?

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Or does it have its sign flip?

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000


110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Unchanged.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And therefore the measurement result for U1 is a--?

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Infinity.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Not infinity, it's infinity and beyond.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a plus-1 eigenstate.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And so Z is going to turn out to be, as you read over there, 0.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's right.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK?

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000


119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
OK.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And what's the result for U2?

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you apply an IZZ to this, see, if you apply III,

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
nothing happens to both of these.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you apply IZZ, remember that Z acting on 0 is 0,

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Z acting on 1 is minus 1.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So Z acting here gives you a minus 1.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Z acting on the third qubit gives you another minus 1.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The two signs cancel out, so then you get a plus-1 again.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So this state is a plus-1 eigenstate of U2, IZZ.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And therefore this measurement result is also 0.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
OK?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, let's try another case.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
a 001 plus b 110.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is the case when the third qubit

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
has had an error occur to it.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So that was a bit flip happening in the bit-flip channel.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And remember, the hypothesis is that each of the qubits

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is going to see an independent and identically

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
distributed channel.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So there's no difference in the channel--

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
no memory in the channel, as well.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And that's a very important assumption.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is the probability with which this is received by Bob?

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000


144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Richard.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
y minus p squared [INAUDIBLE].

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
y minus p squared times p.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now, what are U1 and U2?

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's try U1 first.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That is a ZZI.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000


152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, please.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
0?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
0.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How about U2?

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's IZZ.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000


159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Something new, here.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, please.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
1.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
1.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And tell us why.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because now only one of the things are getting flipped.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And so they keep negative 1?

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah!

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This ZZ hits the 01.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You get one minus sign instead of 2 minus signs.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And so this has a minus sign, and here we

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
have a 10, and that gives you a minus sign, as well.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So this is an overall minus-1 eigenstate of ZZI.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
OK.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, forgive me as I erase this.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's go through another example.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Imagine that the middle bit flips.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000


177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The probability is the same.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now let's do the eigenstates of the syndrome operators again.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What do we get for U0--

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
excuse me, U1?

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Remember, that's ZZI.

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000


183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
1.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
1.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And for U2?

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
[INAUDIBLE]

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Also 1.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Last case.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The first bit flips.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000


191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
OK?

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Same probability.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's U1?

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
1

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Aha.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
1, and U2?

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
0.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
0.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Look at that!

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Four different values of the syndrome operators,

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
four different states.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They also happen to be orthogonal to each other.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's important.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We'll come back to that.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But now we can also figure out what the recovery operator

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
should be.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is a unitary operation that I

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
apply to the state that's received,

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
to make it transform back into the original state that

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
was sent by Alice.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, in this first case, what operator should Bob

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
apply, to get back to the state Alice sent?

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
II.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I II.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You should be saying "II, I."

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
OK?

219
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Second case.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What do you apply?

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
[INAUDIBLE]

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
IIX.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000


224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Or X on 3.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
OK?

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And then this is X on 2, and this is X on 1.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But now we have this nice little table, here.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You just read off from the syndrome that you measured.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then you apply the recovery operator

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that matches that syndrome.

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, please.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So, there's some probability that more than one error

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
occurred--

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes!

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
[INAUDIBLE]

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000


238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Thus we can bound the probability of error

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
by saying, what happens if you have had two errors happen,

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
or three errors happen, and say that in all of those cases

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
we did the wrong thing and got the wrong result?

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
OK.

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So that's going to be equal to 2 times--

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So, instead of one error happening,

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it's going to go as p squared.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Excuse me.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are three possible cases for that-- p squared times 1

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
minus p, and three errors happening.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So, p cubed.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And so, if we sum that up, what we'll want to do

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
is to cast this probability of error

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
in terms of a well-known metric.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And we haven't seen this metric in the class so far,

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but it's called "fidelity."

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000


256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And it's defined as being this function F which

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
takes in a density matrix.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And, for this class, I'll define it

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
as being relative to a pure state,

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
but there are more general cases.

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We'll say that this is defined as being

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the overlap of the pure state with a density matrix,

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
like so, and the fidelity of the state that's received by Bob--

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
so this is the state that Bob decodes.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So this is post-Bob.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not going to write it down so explicitly, there.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's write it down here.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So it's the recovery operator applied to the state

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that Bob receives, which is E of rho,

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
compared with a state that Alice sent, which was psi.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And we can say that this is bounded

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
above by 1 minus this probability error, of error.

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
OK?

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So this is 1 minus 3p squared plus 2p cubed.

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
OK?

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So one p cubed from here, one taken away over here.

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Good?

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, this is one of the signatures of quantum error

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
correction being successful, the fact that this fidelity now

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
goes as p squared instead of going

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
as p, which would be the case if you

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
had done no error correction.

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And experimentalists seek this kind

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
of quadratic turnover in the fidelity, versus a linear one,

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
