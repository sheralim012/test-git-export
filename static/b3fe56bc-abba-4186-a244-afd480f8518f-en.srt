00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Just an example, suppose M is equal to the identity matrix.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In other words, g of v is equal to v. In other words,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
u sigma v u dagger is minus 1 to the f of v

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:41,000
sigma v. Then this quadratic part should basically be 0.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And in this case, f would only be a linear function.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So it would have the form--

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and now the output is a single bit.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it would look like--

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
some arbitrary linear function would

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
looks like the inner product of v with some other vector.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000


12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's call it alpha.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000


14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And can anyone say what unitary u corresponds to this?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000


16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Maybe don't tell me the exact unitary,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but what can you say about the unitary u?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like what kind of Clifford is it?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I've said--

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've narrowed it down.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've said, look, in general, the type of poly

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
can change for the Clifford.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So you conjugate by a Hadamard, it turns x's into z's.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You conjugate by a CNOT, it'll take an x in one qubit

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and spread it to other qubits.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But I'm saying, well, let's consider the kind where

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the type of poly does not change.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The only thing that changes is the sign.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So you conjugate by it.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You get back the same poly, up to a plus or minus.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So one option is that u is itself a product of polys,

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or you can just say a poly matrix itself.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then was there another option for what u could be?

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If this is true for a specific sigma v,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
then you might be able to have some freedom

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
with the [INAUDIBLE].

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But if this is true for all sigma v--

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it turns out the only way for that to happen

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is for u itself to be a poly.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And now this is like the familiar commuting

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
or anti-commuting relation.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So when I move--

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
if u is a poly, when I move it past sigma v,

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I pick up either a plus or minus sign.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And so here, if u--

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
it's a little tricky.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If u is sigma to the lambda alpha,

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
then u sigma v u dagger is going to be minus 1

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to the alpha transpose lambda transpose lambda v sigma

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
v. Right?

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because that's what happens when we

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
move this poly past this other poly, is we pick up this phase.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And the phase looks like--

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you have this symplectic inner product with v on one side,

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and the transpose of this vector on the other side.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000


59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So in this case, where you just have--

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000


61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
where the only action is a phase corresponds

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to this very special subset of Cliffords, which are the polys.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000


64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And when you go beyond polys, then you actually change--

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
then you do more than just pick up a phase.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But this sort of behavior here is

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
kind of another way of stating the fact that polys

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
either commute or anti-commute.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And in fact, they're the only things that

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
only commute or anti-commute with other polys.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So in this special case, g of v is

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
equal to v. So that means that this term and this term

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are the same.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And everything is mod 2.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So then if you have the same term plus itself,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
then you get 0.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So in general, it will not be that simple.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In general, f is going to have some quadratic term.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And so that makes it a little bit

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
tricky to write down in general.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
