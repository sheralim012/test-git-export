0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we're going to go back to quantum error-correcting codes.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And in this lecture, we're going to do a quantum

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
version of the repetition code.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So 0 goes to 0 0 0.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
1 goes to 1 1 1.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, let's try to quantumize it--

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or quantize it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000


9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
0 goes to 0 0 0.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:57,000
1 goes to 1 1 1, and I can write a circuit diagram for that.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000


12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So what happens?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000


14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So you already know that this is not quantum cloning

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
because quantum cloning is impossible.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So alpha 0 plus beta 1 goes to alpha 0 0 0 plus beta 1 1 1.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000


18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So can we correct errors?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000


20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, first let's try to correct the errors.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So what did this channel do?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It corrected one bit error or not channel.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What did that code do?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It corrected one bit error.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So if you flip one bit you can get it back.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000


27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So let's start out by trying sigma z errors.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Or sigma x errors.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sigma x.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, we have three bits.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We can apply sigma x on it.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000


33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And so let's apply a sigma x error

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to the encoded PSI on the second bit.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So PSI uncoded is equal to what?

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's equal to alpha 0 1 0 plus beta 1 0 1.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000


38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Plus beta 1 0 1.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So can we correct this?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000


41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, you can correct measure which bit is different?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000


43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now you would like to measure which

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
bit is different without measuring all three

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
of these bits because if you measure all three

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
of these bits, you put superposition

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
into the code of 0 plus beta 1.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We'd like the same supervision to come out of the code

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
after you've decoded it.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So how do you measure which is this different?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, actually that's pretty easy.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:50,000


53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So here is our encoded psi.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000


55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I encoded and we apply a control naught from the first bit

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to the second but a control up from the first

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to the third bit.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Back here we apply a control naught

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
from the first to the second and the control

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
naught from the first to the third.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You get 0.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You get a so 0 0-- alpha 0 0 0 plus beta 1 1 1

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
goes to alpha 0 0 0 plus beta 1 0 0, and you measure two zeros.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So that's good.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And you can see that this decoding circuit is really

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the inverse of the encoding circuit.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000


68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So that's very good.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000


70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And now, what do we have here?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000


72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sigma x.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000


74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, what happens if you made acute an error there?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Alpha so suppose you put alpha 0 1 0 plus beta 1

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
0 1 into that circuit.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000


78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sign error maybe equals that.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
When you put it into that circuit, you get out alpha 0 1

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
0 plus beta 1 1 0 because you're doing the control naught

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
from this guy who this guy and from the first guy

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to the third guy.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And you measure 1 0 and your state is alpha 0 plus beta 1

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
because this is equal to alpha 0 plus beta 1 times 1 0

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and you're measuring these guys.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
From so what you measure tells you

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that your second bit is wrong, and you've

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
recovered the first bit.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000


90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So suppose you put in alpha 1 0 0 plus

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
beta 0 1 1 so that's our error state.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So we've got this by applying sigma x to the first qubit.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000


94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:09,000
After circuit, you get alpha 1 1 1 plus beta 0 1 1

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is equal to alpha 1 plus beta 0 times 1 1.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And of course, you measure 1 1.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So what do you need to do to this state to fix it?

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000


99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah?

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Apply z?

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Apply?

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Apply x.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Apply x.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So if these are both ones, these measurement results

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
are both ones.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000


108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You apply x here.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And maybe I should draw classical stop and green.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000


111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that's how you decode the qubit

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but of course, not everything is a sigma x error.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's also sigma z errors.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So what happens if we apply a sigma z error to this code?

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000


116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, there are three things you could apply the sigma z to.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The first, second, or third qubit.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What do we get?

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, here we get alpha 0 0 0 minus beta 1 1 1.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Here we get alpha 0 0 0 minus well

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
it's the same thing, right?

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And here we get the same thing again.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000


124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And all of these are encoded alpha 0 minus beta 1.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000


126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So what have we done?

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, so we'll call this the bit error correcting code.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
3 qubit bit error correction.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000


130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, if you have sigma x corrected

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and if you have a sigma z, you've

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
applied sigma z to the encoded qubit.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
