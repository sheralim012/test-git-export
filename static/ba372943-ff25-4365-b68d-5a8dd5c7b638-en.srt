0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Suppose we have a dephasing channel.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And let's say that's 1 minus q, you apply

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a sigma z, and probability q.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
1 minus qu applied nothing.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Probability q, you apply to sigma z.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000


7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Probability of error is--

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
well, you get an error if you apply a sigma z to any qubit.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000


10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And you don't get an error if you apply sigma z

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to an even number of qubits.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's 3q plus q cubed.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000


14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
3q 1 minus q plus q cubed.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
3q 1 minus q squared plus q cubed.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000


17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Around 3 times the chance of error, of unencoded error.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000


19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sigma z.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000


21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to say this.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So three times the chance of sigma

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
z error on an unencoded qubit.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But if you have a debiting channel--

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
if you have a channel 1 minus q sigma x.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait, 1 minus q identity and q sigma x.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Probability of error, well, you need at least two

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of these qubits to be wrong, to have

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
an error in the original and encoded qubit.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So the probability of error is q 3q

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
squared 1 minus q plus q cubed.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So this is quadratically small if q is small,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and this is 3 times, 3q, if q is small.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So we've corrected the bit errors

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and we've made the phase errors even worse.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000


37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, you probably know that Hadamard interchange

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
phase errors and bit errors.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:34,000


40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So intuitively, this should mean that you can take this code

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and Hadamard it and get a code that corrects phase errors,

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but makes bit errors three times as worse.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So let's do it.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The bit code, or the bit correcting code,

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
was 0, goes to 0, 0, 0.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
1 goes to 1, 1, 1.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000


48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So let's say this is the phase code.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's going to take H0 to H cubed 0, 0, 0.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
H1 to H cubed 1, 1, 1.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000


52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And this is just 0 plus 1, 1 over 2 goes to 1 over root

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
8 0, 0, 0 plus 0, 0, 1 plus dot dot dot plus 1, 1, 1.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And 1 over root 2 0 minus 1 goes to 1 over root

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
8 0, 0, 0 minus 0, 0, 1 through minus 1, 1, 1.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000


57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And this is minus 1 the number of 1s in this state.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we work this out for Simon's algorithm.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And this is what Hadamard cubed does.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It puts a minus 1 any state with an odd number of 1s.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000


62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We can add these and we can subtract these to get

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
what our code does to 0 and 1.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So phase code 0 goes to 0, 0, 0 plus 0, 1, 1 plus 1,

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
0, 1 plus 1, 1, 0.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
1 goes to 1/2 0, 0, 0--

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:38,000
sorry-- 0, 0, 1 plus 0, 1, 0 plus 1, 0, 0 minus 1, 1 plus 1,

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
1, 1.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you take 0 to the superposition

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of states with an even number of 1s,

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and 1 to a superposition of states

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
with an odd number of 1s.

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000


74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because when you subtract this from this,

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you only get states with an odd number of 1s.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And when you add these, you only get states

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
with an even number of 1s.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000


79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So you can correct this.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And actually, it should be obvious

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that you can correct this, because all we did

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
was we put a Hadamard in front of everything.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So just take your old correction circuit

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and add a whole bunch of Hadamards

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and you get a new correction circuit for the phase code.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But I want to explain it a different way.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000


88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's call this a logical 0, and this a logical 1.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000


90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So logical 0, logical 1.

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sigma z on the first qubit, logical 0.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sigma z on the first qubit, logical 1.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sigma z on the second qubit, logical 0, et cetera--

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
are all orthogonal.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000


96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, we can see that up here--

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, we can know first, clearly, 0 and 1 are

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
orthogonal, because none of these basis

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
states in the supervision of 1 appears in supervision of 0.

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And when you apply a sigma z to any of the bits,

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
this is still true.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So any sigma z error on 1 is orthogonal to any other sigma z

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
error on 0.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And further, if you apply sigma z error to 0,

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so sigma z on the first qubit of 0, logical 0,

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is equal to 1 over 2 0, 0, 0 plus 0, 1, 1 minus 1,

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
0, 1 minus 1, 1, 0.

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So half the terms here are plus, half the term here are minus.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So this is orthogonal to that.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And it's easy to check that all of these are orthogonal.

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So project onto subspaces 0L 1L sigma z 1 0L sigma z 1 1L,

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
et cetera.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So these are four orthogonal subspaces.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So this is a measurement that projects the state onto one

115
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
of these four subspaces.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000


117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And in this case, if you get this subspace, you do nothing.

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000


119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you get this subspace, you apply

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
sigma z for the first qubit.

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you get the next subspace, you apply sigma z

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to the second qubit, et cetera.

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000


124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So this shows you how to correct these errors.

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
