0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I've encoded one qubit into this code.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I can act on it by doing these five X and five Z operators.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And by the way, this should give you

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a hint of why it's possible to protect quantum data in a code

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and still act on it with your quantum computer.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Because in order to actually manipulate

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the logical information, I need to hit all five qubits.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's say I want to do a logical Z or a logical X.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I need to do X or Z to all five qubits.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can do that on my quantum computer.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I could just, in parallel, shine a laser beam on each ion,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for example.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Or send a microwave pulse in parallel

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to each superconducting qubit.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But the environment is unlikely to coordinate in this way.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this is kind of why I can use a quantum error-correcting code

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and still manipulate the information while it

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
gets protected from error.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or so I claim it's protected from error.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I haven't actually demonstrated that yet.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let me now justify that.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So when we talk about error correction of the five qubit

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
code.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So I claim that each single qubit Pauli error

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
leads to a distinct syndrome.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000


27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And what I mean by syndrome is I'm given some state

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Psi which is in the code space.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000


30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Some noise happens, and it gets mapped to a mixed state Rho.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then I measure these four stabilizer generators.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So let me just call these little S1, little S2, little S3,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
little S4.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000


35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I obtain outcomes.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's say minus 1 to the B1, through minus 1

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to the B4, where B1 through B4 are in 0, 1.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This B1 through B4, I'm calling the syndrome.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just like for linear code, classically we

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
do these parity checks that tell us

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
whether we're in the code space or out of the code space.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here we measure the stabilizers.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If we're in the code space all of them

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
will be plus one eigenstates.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So here I can say, this is minus 1 to the 0 or 1.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then all of these B1 through B4 would be 0.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So no error means that B is equal to 0000.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And it's not a priori obvious but I

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
claim that any error will lead to B being

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
not only non-zero but even distinct for different errors.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I claim different errors lead to distinct non-zero B.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So before I justify this, let me try and argue why

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that is the right thing to do.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why do I care that these give non-zero B

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
or that they are distinct?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000


57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, actually, let me do it in the other order.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me prove this is true and then we'll

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
talk about why it's important.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000


61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let me actually analyze a slightly different protocol.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Suppose we also measure S5, which is a product of S1

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
through S4.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In other words, it's this final line here.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course, the outcome B5 will just B1 plus B4, mod 2.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, I can interpret these as elements of F2.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because there is no extra information here--

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
these are commuting operators-- so once I've

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
measured these four, I'm in a simultaneous eigenstate

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
of the four of them, I'm not going

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to get any extra information from S5.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I can sort of assume that I've measured it

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
without loss of generality.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It adds or takes away nothing.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The only reason to do it is it makes the analysis

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
of what I'm writing down a little bit cleaner

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and a little more symmetric.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
OK, so, with that out of the way,

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
let's look at what happens when we have a single qubit error.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So suppose the error is X1.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So the state is X1 times Psi.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000


83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is the syndrome going to be?

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000


85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So in other words, when we measure these stabilizers,

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
when are we going to get plus 1, when are we going at minus 1?

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If there is no error, then we're in the code space.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
All of them are plus 1.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But this X1 commutes with some of the stabilizers

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and anti-commutes with others.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And so, what happens is, if it commutes with the stabilizer,

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it leaves a plus 1 eigenstate of that stabilizer.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But if it anti-commutes it flips it to minus 1.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So to figure out the syndrome, we

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
need to figure out which one of these

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
it commutes and anti-commutes with.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So let's go through.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For S1, what does it do, commute or anti-commute?

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
[INAUDIBLE]

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's that?

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Anti-commute.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Anti-commute.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why is that?

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
[INAUDIBLE]

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You just look at the first position and there's a Z here.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What about S2?

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Commute.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
S3?

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Anti.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And S4?

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Commute.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And of course, S5 also commutes.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So let's write down the little table of syndromes.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
X1, da da da.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
1, 0, 1, 0, 0.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Say this is B1, B2, B3, B4, B5.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, something nice happens.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't need to look over there anymore

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
because of the cyclic symmetry.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I want to figure out X2, X3, X4, X5.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I just know what all those rows are.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just rotate.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So this next one is--

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
X2 is 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
X3, I rotate again.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
X4, keep rotating.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000


129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Et cetera.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000


131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Did I get that right?

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000


134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
OK?

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So once I know the X1 row, I know all the others,

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
because they're just related by cyclic shifts.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000


138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Any questions about this?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000


140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OK.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What about the Z1?

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000


143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So here, commute, commute, commute, anti, anti.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right?

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So let's go over here and write it down.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
0, 0, 0, 1, 1.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then if you go to the other Z's, you're

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
just going to cyclically shift this again.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000


150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
0, 1, 1.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:20,000


152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So these are all of the patterns you

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
can get from a single Z error.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000


155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And we're almost done.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The other areas we have to consider are the single qubit

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Y's.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000


159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Again, I don't want to go back and look at that board.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So how can I calculate the row for Y1?

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000


162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I heard an answer but it's-- yeah?

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
[INAUDIBLE]

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So up to a phase, Y is a product of X and Z.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And that phase does not change the commuting,

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
anti-commuting properties.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So I can just add together the top row here

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and the top row here.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And so I get 1, 0, 1, 1, 1.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then I get all the cyclic shifts of this.

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Et cetera.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So now I have these patterns of syndromes.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000


176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I claim that they're all distinct.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And there's no fancy proof.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's just, you know, there's only 16 of them.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And you can tell they're all different.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The X's, there's two ones with a zero in the middle.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Z's, there are two ones next to each other,

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and the Y's, they're four ones.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think if you didn't have the fifth column, all of this

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
would be a little less obvious.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But with the fifth column it makes the argument

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
a little bit more obvious.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I've proved my claim that different errors give you

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
distinct, and not only distinct, but all nonzero B's.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Syndrome vector is B.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So why do I care about this?

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The reason is-- let's go back to the quantum error-correcting

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
conditions.

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000


194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So we want is that if Psi is in the code space, then Psi EB

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
dagger EA Psi--

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,000


197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
well actually, let me--

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,000
sorry.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let me do it a different way.

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So why care about the syndrome?

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So the first argument is a little more operational,

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which is, given B, we can correct the error.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So suppose what happens is, an unknown poly

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
happens to our code.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This gives us a recipe for correcting it

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
because that poly is unitary.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So if we knew what the poly was, we could undo that unitary

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and recover our information.

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The only problem is, we don't know what it is.

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So for example, in the depolarizing channel, an I,

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
X, Y or Z gets randomly applied.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you don't know what that is, you

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
don't know how to correct it.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But this gives us a way to figure out exactly what it is.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You just measure these stabilizers,

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
look up in these little tables which pattern

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
your syndrome corresponds to, and then that

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
will tell you exactly which poly happened.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Then that poly is just unitary.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can apply another unitary to undo it.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And so this says, in other words,

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
there exists a recovery map.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I think that's the simplest argument why

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
this is sufficient.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And by the way, one of the possible errors

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is no error, right?

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that corresponds to the all zero string.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And so it's reassuring that that's

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
distinct from all the other ones.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If there was some error that looks the same as no error,

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
then we might potentially be in trouble.

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But that's not actually the case.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Every single qubit error is distinguishable

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
from each other, but also distinguishable from no error

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
at all.

236
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000


237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The second argument is, in terms of the quantum error-correcting

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
conditions.

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So we said that if Psi 1, Psi 2 are orthogonal,

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
then Psi 1 E1 dagger, E2, Psi 2 should also be orthogonal.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And the reason why they are orthogonal

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:42,000
is because these lead to distinct eigenspaces of S1

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
through S4.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The fact that the measurements come out differently

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
means that E2 will send you into one eigenspace--

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
simultaneous eigenspace of S1, S2, S3, S4.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
E1 will send you into a different one.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And we know that distinct eigenspaces

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
of Hermitian matrices are orthogonal.

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And so that means that this vector and that vector

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
have to be orthogonal to each other.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Unless, of course, E2 and E1 are the same poly, exactly.

253
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And then this cancels out.

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And we use the fact that the states

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
were originally orthogonal.

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So one way or another, we get that the final states

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
