1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The stabilizer formalism provides

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
an efficient description of an important subgroup

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of quantum gates and states.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let us begin with a basic definition of the Pauli group

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
acting on n qubits.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This group is formed from the set of all n-fold tensor

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
products of the usual Pauli operators

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that we have looked at acting on single qubits-- namely X, Y,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and Z, and also the numbers 1 and i, plus or minus.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For example, the Pauli group acting on 1 qubit

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
has among its elements identity, X, Y, Z,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and all of its products and plus or minus i and so forth.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Note that for two elements g and h in a Pauli group,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
either they commute or anticommute-- that is,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
g times h is hg or minus hg.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now we define what a stabilizer is.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
For a given vector subspace defined by basis states,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
orthogonal basis states psi sub l-- we'll

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
label this vector space V sub s, so V

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
sub s is given by the span of the basis vectors psi

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
sub l-- the stabilizer for this vector space

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is the set of all elements in the Pauli group

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
such that the states psi are eigenstates with eigenvalue

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
plus 1 for all psi in the vector space.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We say that S stabilizes psi.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And by convention, minus identity is not in S.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And this, thus, lets S be an Abelian group-- that

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is, all the elements in S will commute with each other.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We will have no anticommuting elements

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
within a given stabilizer.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let us consider a few examples, starting out with the vector

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
space given by a single state 00.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is the stabilizer for this single state?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, ZZ acting on this state leaves it unchanged,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
as does IZ, ZI, and II, because the zero state is a plus 1

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
eigenstate of the Z operator.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We may also see that this stabilizer

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
set is generated by just two of these, IZ and ZI.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This means that all the elements of the stabilizer

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
come from products of these generators.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Of course, we could have chosen other elements

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
for the generator, but the general idea

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
is to find the minimum set of generating elements.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now let's move to another example.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Consider the vector space defined by this single state,

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
00 plus 11 divided by square root of 2.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is its stabilizer?

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, XX leaves this state unchanged,

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
as does ZZ and II.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And XX times ZZ gives minus YY.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
More succinctly, we may write the stabilizer

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
as being generated by XX and ZZ.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why does the generator have this minimum size of just XX

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and ZZ, two elements?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, in general, for a vector space of dimension 2 to the k,

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
meaning k qubits, we find that k is

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
equal to n minus the minimum number of generators of S,

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and this is because each generator has

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the number of degrees of freedom left over for the vector space.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We'll return to this several times later.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, here is an example where I specify the stabilizer

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to be X and Y and ask you what the vector space stabilized is.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It turns out in this case, V sub S is the null space.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Think about it and see if you can understand why.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now let's look at a two-dimensional vector space

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
spanned, say, by 000 and 111.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is the stabilizer for this vector space?

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
By inspection, you can see that both 000 and 111 are plus 1

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
eigenstates of ZZ, two Z operators applied to any two

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
qubits.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And thus, we may find that S is generated by IZZ and ZZI.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is kind of neat.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Remember, these are the syndrome operators

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that we found for the 3 bit quantum bit flip code, parity

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
check between two qubits.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is not a coincidence, as we will see shortly.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In fact, let us look at the vector space

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
given by the 9-qubit Shor code.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Recall that the states are 000 plus and minus 111,

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
repeated three times.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What is a stabilizer for this 9-qubit code

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which encodes k equal 1 qubits?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, from counting, we know there

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
must be at least eight generators,

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and it turns out these are exactly the syndrome operators

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that we have for the 9-qubit code.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Go and check this for yourself.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now suppose I give you the stabilizer

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and tell you it is generated by XX.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What vector space is stabilized by this stabilizer?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, we saw before 00 plus 11 is a plus 1 eigenstate of XX,

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
but also 01 plus 10.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So this is an example of a 2-qubit space

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
with a single qubit vector subspace stabilized

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
by a stabilizer with one nontrivial generator.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now consider another example, where the vector space is just

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the state 1.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is the stabilizer for the 1 state?

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, it is minus Z. Just like we

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
saw before, the stabilizer for the 0 state is the Z operator.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is our first example of where

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the stabilizer has a negative Pauli element inside it.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But note that minus Z squared is identity,

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so S still does not have minus identity in it.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Here is another example, again, of a two-dimensional vector

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
space, this time with 01 plus 10 and 11.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is the stabilizer for this vector space?

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, go think about it.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then, as a last example, this vector space spanned

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
by 000 plus 111, a single state.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The stabilizer has elements XXX, ZZI, and IZZ.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
These are actually generators for the stabilizer.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And in contrast with the 3 bit code,

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we have had to add one extra generator, namely XXX,

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
because the vector space is a single state and not a two-dimensional space.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
