1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
OK, so what do we get from the symplectic inner product?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So a stabilizer subgroup corresponds

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to some set of vectors in F2 to the 2n

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that are all orthogonal with respect to this inner product.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So Vi transposed lambda Vj equals 0.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So before I said that a stabilizer subgroup

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is a bunch of commuting [? polys. ?]

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And now we have kind of a linear algebraic way of putting it.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's just a bunch of vectors that are all

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
orthogonal to each other.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And they should also be linearly independent.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So this is basically like the symplectic version

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
of an orthonormal basis.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Maybe I should say orthogonal basis.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't actually care if the vector is orthogonal to itself.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So it's for i not equal to j.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
[INAUDIBLE]

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That was your question.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So let me say this maybe a little bit more formally.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let me say that--

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000


24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so let me define sigma.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000


26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let's suppose that V is equal to the vector bc, and sigma

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
superscript V means sigma sub b--

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
sorry, x to the b, z to the c.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then sigma V1 through sigma Vl is a stabilizer group

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
if and only if V1 through Vl is an orthogonal--

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000


32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
sorry, let me say they are orthogonal and linearly

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
independent.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000


35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So this puts it into kind of a more familiar linear algebra

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
