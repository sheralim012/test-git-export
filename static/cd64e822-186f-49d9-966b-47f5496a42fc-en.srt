00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Partial trace on density matrix rho is--

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
well, you can do the same thing as representing--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000


4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
let's call this trace A psi, psi, A, B.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I really should have done this, because you can only

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
apply partial traces to density matrices, and not pure states,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:44,000
formally, although is summation from i e sub i, rho e sub i.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And rho is on a bipartite system,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and e sub i's are only for the first [INAUDIBLE]..

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So here, we have a formula for the trace

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which uses some basis for the first system.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So suppose you have two bases for the first system.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000


14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We have two bases for system a, e sub i and f sub i--

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000


16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, if you have two bases for the same system,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
there is a unitary matrix, which takes one basis to the other.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And we can assume that e sub j is equal to sum ujk f sub k,

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
where ujk, u are the elements of a unitary matrix.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000


21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So we have a unitary matrix taking e's taking, I guess,

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
f's to the e's.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000


24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And now, summation j, ej, rho ej is equal to summation.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:40,000
k summation k prime f sub k ujk dagger rho f sub k prime,

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ujk prime.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000


28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And that is equal to--

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000


30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I left out the summation for j, so we put it back in.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, let's put summation for j inside,

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and we have k k prime summation ujk dagger ujk prime

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
f sub k rho fk prime.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, this is equal to sum k k prime fk rho fk prime,

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
which is just this formula, where the e is replaced

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
by the f's.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And why is this?

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000


39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ujk is a unitary matrix, which means

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
any two different rows are orthogonal

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and the inner product of rho with itself is 1.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And this is just the inner product

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
of a row k with row k prime.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000


45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wait, am I saying rows when I should be saying columns?

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's see, jk.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, this is just the inner product

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
of column k with column k prime.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And that means that if k equals k prime, then this is 1.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If k is different from k prime, it's

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
0, which gives you the Kronecker delta, function,

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which gives you that.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So it doesn't matter which bases for system

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that you use in this formula, you get the same partial trace.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000


56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And why is it called partial trace?

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Trace of psi a, or rather, suppose

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you have two different matrices, sigma sub a tensor sigma sub b

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is equal to trace sigma a times sigma b.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So if you have a tensor product of two matrices,

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the partial trace just takes the trace of the first one.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And if you have something that's not the tensor product of two

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
matrices, you can break it up into a sum

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
of tensor products of the two matrices and use this formula.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So this is why it's called partial trace,

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
because it's just the, I guess, linearization of the operator

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
trace of sigma a times sigma b.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
