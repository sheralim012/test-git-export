00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me mention one very important special case,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is measurements.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So you may have seen measurements originally defined

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
as you take the amplitudes and you absolute values them,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and you get some probabilities.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And then you may have heard, well,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
they're more general forms of measurement as well.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let me start in the other direction

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and say what is the most general possible quantum measurement

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that could be defined?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So in general, a measurement is a channel that--

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because everything's a quantum operation.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Every physical thing that can happen.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But this is a special one that outputs classical information.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So it'll be one that takes in quantum states

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and outputs a probability distribution.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And a probability distribution, as we saw before,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
can be thought of just as a diagonal density matrix.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is saying is that N of rho always has a diagonal output.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's say that the output corresponds

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to n measurement outcomes and that.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000


23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we have some orthonormal basis, 1 through n,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the output N of rho is just the probabilities

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
of the measurement outcomes along the diagonal.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So this is the most general possible measurement

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that we can have.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000


29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And now, we can talk about the conditions for it.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000


31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So by linearity, the output of N of rho

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
should be a linear function of the inputs.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And so in particular, Px should be a linear function

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
of the input row.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000


36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And what does that mean, a linear function?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It means the first, the upper-left entry

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
of rho times something plus the next entry

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of rho times something, etc.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And there's a compact way of writing this.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We can just define some matrix and write

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Px is equal to trace of rho times some matrix Mx.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mx is some completely general matrix.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's how I describe a completely general

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
linear function of rho And so corresponding

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to this measurement, what we have

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
are a collection of matrices.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So the measurement, we can describe it

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in terms of the channel N or in terms of the matrices M1,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
M2 through Mn each matrix telling you

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
about the probability of getting a particular outcome.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000


53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So now, I've said these matrices are fully general.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But we haven't used all the properties that we know.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So one property we know is being trace preserving.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In this case, it just means that probabilities are normalized.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So 1 is equal to the sum of the Px, which

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
is equal to the sum over x of trace rho Mx.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000


60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And now, this should be--

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
let me, actually, manipulate it a little more.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let me write this as trace of rho times sum over x Mx.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000


64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now, this should be true for all choices of rho

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So whatever this operator is, it should be the case

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that you multiply it by any rho and you get out probability 1.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000


68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it turns out that uniquely describes this operator.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The only possible operator is the identity matrix.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I should put if and only if.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So this is the normalization condition on our measurements.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000


73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We also have the positivity requirement.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I don't need to actually use complete positivity.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ordinary positivity will be enough.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So complete positivity, though, implies

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that each probability in the output is non-negative.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So why is that?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, it says if you take an input that's PSD,

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the output should be a PSD matrix.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But what does it mean for a diagonal matrix to be PSD?

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, that means the eigenvalues are all non-negative,

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So saying this matrix is PSD is the same

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
as saying all the probabilities are non-negative.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So now, what does that mean in terms of the Mx?

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we have that trace Mx rho is greater than 0 for all rho

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So it turns out this is equivalent to saying that Mx

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
is positive semi-definite.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000


91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And the reason is, if x were not positive semi-definite,

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I could choose rho to be a pure state

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
corresponding to a negative eigenvalue of Mx,

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and then I would get a negative number.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Whereas if it is positive semi-definite,

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you can use one of those equivalent conditions,

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the one about the quadratic forms being non-negative,

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to show that this is non-negative.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000


100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So we now have these two conditions on measurements.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Here, we have a collection of matrices.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But we know a little bit more.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They should add up to identity and they

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
should each be non-negative.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
