0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We have a code that corrects bit errors,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
corrects sigma x errors, and makes sigma z errors

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
three times as likely.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have a code that corrects sigma z errors,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and make sigma x errors three times less likely.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You can easily check if you have a sigma x error.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It takes a logical 0 to a logical 1, and vice versa.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, a sigma x error on any of the three bit qubits

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
flips the logical 0 and logical 1,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so it applies the sigma x to the logical qubit.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, I mean, this is you know, you

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
squeeze on the phase errors.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your bit errors blow up.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You squeeze on the bit error, the phase errors blow up.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So how do you fix this?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000


17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, what you do is what is called concatenation.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, what you do is you combine the two codes

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so that they fix both bit errors and phase errors.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And in classical coding theory, it's

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
called concatenating with two codes.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So first, what you do is you encode the code

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with one of these codes.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then we encode each of the qubits

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in the remaining code with the other.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, I have zero--

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll just write it down--

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,000
do one over 2, 3, 9/2 000 plus 111 Is 9/2,

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'd 9/2 is the wrong number.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:58,000
1 over square of 8 000 plus 1 1 1 000 plus 111.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, you're encoding 1 qubit into 9 qubits.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And 1 goes to 1 over root 8 000 minus 111 000 minus 111 000

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:41,000
minus 111.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, to correct, first correct inner code.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000


36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, the inner code is just our bit error

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
correcting code, which means if there's a bit error,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you correct it.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000


40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So let's say we have a sigma x error.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000


42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What happens?

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
On, let's say, the fifth qubit, you had 0, 0, 0.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You had the first of these, then zeros--

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
1, 0, plus or minus 1, 0, 1, and then the third piece,

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the plus or minus depending on whether you

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
have a logical 0 or logical 1.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And we know how to correct this.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We ask which bit is different, and then we flip that bit.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000


51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Bit is different.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000


53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
flip that bit.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000


55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OK.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's save that.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OK.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sigma z error, 5 error, 0, 0, 0, plus 1, 1, 1.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So these are, I want to say, the fourth, fifth, and sixth bits.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000


61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Goes to 0, 0, 0, minus 1, 1, 1 on the fourth and six bits.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well this is a logical 0, and this is a logical 1.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So really, it's a logical error in the code.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000


65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Or, rather-- well, not really, but I mean, OK.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's say this is 0 x and this is 1 x.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000


68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So you can think of a code that encodes a 0 as this,

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and a code that encodes a 1 as this.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000


71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, what we've done is we've--

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000


73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
x goes to 0.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
x, 1 x, 0 x.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because we took the middle of these three triplets of qubits,

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and we took it with this other thing,

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and if we call this 0 x and 1 x, this

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is just a bit error on the middle qubit.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So we can correct it.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We correct it exactly the same way,

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and we compare this state, this state, and this state,

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and take the majority of them, whether they

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
have a plus or minus.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And you can write down a circuit for that,

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
but I'm not going to, because it's rather complicated,

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and I'm not entirely sure how illuminating it is.

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But maybe we'll make you do it on the homework.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000


89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So that's the nine-qubit code.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000


91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So far, we've shown that the nine-qubit code can

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
correct a sigma x error, and it can correct a sigma z error.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And in fact, it can correct a sigma y error,

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because a sigma y error is just a simultaneous sigma x error

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and sigma z error.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And correcting the sigma x error here

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
does not interfere with the sigma z error.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So you can correct that later.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000


100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So the nine-qubit code corrects one error of any--

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
well, of sigma x sigma y, sigma z.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But of course, there's lots and lots

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
of errors that aren't sigma x, sigma y, or sigma z.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean, you could apply a Hadamard gate

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to one of the qubits.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Does it correct that as well?

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000


108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, there is a theorem.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I don't want to get rid of the base code.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So let's erase this.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Theorem.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000


113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you can correct identity--

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
OK, so any code had better be able to correct

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the no error, sigma x, sigma y, sigma z, on any qubit.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Actually, we shouldn't say the identity.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's the identity on all the qubits.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you can correct sigma x, sigma y, or signal z

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
on any single qubit, you can correct any one-qubit error.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000


121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I mean, you can take your qubit and just remove it and add 1

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in its place, and that gets corrected.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or you can make a Hadamard gate on it,

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or a rotation of any kind, or measure it,

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and they all get corrected.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So you only need to correct sigma x, sigma y, sigma z

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
errors.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I am going to demonstrate this for the phase code

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
where it's basically-- if you can correct the identity,

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
or if you can correct no errors, and if you

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
can correct a phase error on any qubit,

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
you can correct any phase error.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, if you can correct the sigma z on any qubit,

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you can correct any phase error on any given.

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000


136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And this is very much related to the fact

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that this de-phasing channel could also

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
be done by having a small phase error with probability 1/2,

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and the opposite phase error with probability of 1/2.

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
