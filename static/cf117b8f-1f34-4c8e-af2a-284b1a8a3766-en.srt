1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Technically, all I've shown you is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that if you're in the Clifford group then

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you can be described by a symplectic transformation,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
up to this issue of phase.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have not seen the reverse.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I claim that if you have any symplectic transformation

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
on F2, then there exists a Clifford

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
unitary that will realize it.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In other words, it will map polys

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
according to the desired matrix M.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And that is something I am not going to prove in class.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You will sort of prove most of the parts of this on the p-set.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So this is a claim, evidence to be supplied by you later

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
on the p-set.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But right now, I just want to claim

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that those are equivalent.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I claim for any symplectic M, there exists some U such

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that U sigma v u dagger is plus or minus sigma

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mv for all v in F2 to the 2n.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So my claim is that if and only if,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
