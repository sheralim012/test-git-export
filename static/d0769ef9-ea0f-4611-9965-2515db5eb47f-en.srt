00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
OK, one left, complete positivity.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's suppose that rho is positive semdefinite.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then I can write rho in the form W W dagger.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Remember, PSD has these three equivalent conditions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the one that people usually don't talk about.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Every so often, it comes in handy.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So now, what's N of rho--

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
sorry.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
N tensor identity of rho is sum over e,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ve tensor identity W W dagger Ve dagger tensor identity.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000


12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So it looks like a mess until you realize there's a pattern.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This operator here is the dagger of that operator there.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I can write this, if I call this thing, let's say, Xe,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
this is just sum over e, Xe Xe dagger.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000


17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So what do I know about Xe Xe dagger?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000


19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is it positive semidefinite, for example?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This also satisfies that condition,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and the sum of [? PSD ?] things is also [? PSD. ?] So this is

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a [? PSD ?] matrix.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000


25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So we've satisfied the trace preserving,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and now the completely positive conditions.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000


28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, this shouldn't surprise us

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because we derived Kraus operators in a way

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
where they should have preserved the set of density matrices.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is just a more direct way of seeing it.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000


33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And this gives you one direction of the equivalents

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I said that trace preserving TPCP

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
maps have Kraus decompositions.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just showed you the opposite, or the converse [INAUDIBLE]..

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you have a Kraus decomposition,

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
then you are a TPCP map.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So the other direction is the one

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that will actually prove this claim of completeness

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that I said.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That channels with Kraus decompositions

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
are all there is.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
