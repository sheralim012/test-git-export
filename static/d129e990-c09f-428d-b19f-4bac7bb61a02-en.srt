00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
If you've taken physics classes with special relativity,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
you've probably seen another example

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of transformations that preserve a non-euclidian inner product.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And those are the Lorentz transformations.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So there, the inner product--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
instead of this lambda matrix, you put in 1, 1, 1, minus 1.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then you ask, what are transformations that

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
preserve that inner product?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And those are called Lorentz transformations,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and they correspond to rotations and boost,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the things you get from special relativity.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the corresponding group is called the Lorentz group.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so for any inner product, you

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
can talk about the group of matrices that preserve it.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the Lorentz group is a little

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
different than the symplectic group,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but it's all kind of in the same spirit.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
