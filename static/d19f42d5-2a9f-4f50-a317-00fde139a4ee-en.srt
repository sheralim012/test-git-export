1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a very important fact about quantum error correction.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the early days of quantum computing

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
after short factoring algorithm came out,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
there were arguments on--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this may show my age-- but there's

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
something called Usenet, which was like an early Twitter you

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
could say.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And there were arguments on Usenet

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
about whether quantum computers could ever

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
be realized because of noise.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They said well, these look very powerful,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but we've already known that in-theory analog computers are

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
very powerful.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
These amplitudes of quantum computers,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
they just look like the real numbers

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that you see in analog quantum computers.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so we should maybe not be surprised

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that this model is more powerful.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But we know that analog computers cannot be realized

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
at least not to very high precision

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
because if the voltage--

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
if all of the voltages are legal values, right--

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
in a digital computer, it's either 0 volts or 5 volts.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everything else is illegal.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So if the computer sees 4.9, it knows

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
it should bump it up to five.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But in analog computer, if 3.7 is legal,

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a legal voltage, and 3.700001 is also legal voltage,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
there's nothing the computer can do

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to know if there's a little drift of voltage,

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
if that was supposed to happen, or if it is something

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that should be corrected.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So analog computing is fundamentally not

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
error correctable.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In some cases that's OK.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If your stereo doesn't produce exactly the right sound then

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that's fine.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But if you want to use these real numbers

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for some complicated math calculation, it's not so good.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And so there was that argument given

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that quantum computers suffered the same limitation

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
as analog computers, namely you can not

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
error correct amplitudes.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And indeed, if you have some error that looks like e

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to the i faded z--

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and it just is in notation by the way.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let me-- I'm going to write x equals sigma

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
x, y equals sigma y z.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From now on, I'm going to use this kind of quantum computing

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
notation for the Pauli matrices.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I find this error, e to the i fade to z.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Data can continuously vary.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It could be very, very small.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, I can't distinguish all those different errors,

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so how can I correct them?

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That was a compelling argument against quantum computers

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
before quantum error correcting codes came along.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I think [INAUDIBLE] used that discussion that

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
was part of what pushed Peter Schorr and others to develop

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
quantum error correcting codes.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And the answer we have today is that e to the i fade to z

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is a linear combination of i and z.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And so if I have a code that can correct i and z,

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
then I can also correct at no extra cost

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
all linear combinations of them.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I can correct e to the i fade to z for all values of z.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000


68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So it's a remarkable and crucial feature of quantum error action

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that the space of errors they corrected is a linear subspace.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
