00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What happens when you apply unitaries to density matrices?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ensemble psi of i with probability p of i.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Apply u and you get u psi of i with probability p of i.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000


5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the density matrix here was row

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
equals summation p of i psi psi.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000


8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the density matrix here is going

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to be rho tilda equals sum p of i.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, we now have u psi of i instead of psi of i.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So u psi of i, and now psi of i u dagger.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000


13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, again, we use linearity.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And this is just summation.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
p of i-- wait.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What we want to do is we want to move

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the u outside the summation.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So this gives u summation p of i psi of i,

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
or rather the projection onto psi of i, u dagger.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But this is row.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Equals u row u dagger.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you apply a unitary to a density matrix,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you get u row u dagger.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
