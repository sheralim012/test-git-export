1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the next section is on quantum error correction,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and we'll tell you how to construct quantum

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
error correcting codes and how to analyze how well they work.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And for that, we need noisy quantum systems.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So you remember from last time, I

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
talked about classical channels and classical error

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
correcting codes and Shannon's theorem.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And Shannon's theorem, binary symmetric, 1 minus p, p, p,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
1 minus p.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We had binary symmetric channels.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And so if you stuck in a 1 with probability p, it came out a 0.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And with probability 1, it comes out a 1.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you stick out a 0 with probability 1 minus p,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it comes at as 0.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
With probability p, it comes out with a 1.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we can ask, is there a quantum equivalent?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000


18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And the answer is yes.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And at the end of the lecture, I hope

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to get to tell you what this is.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But first, we need to construct something first.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What is a noisy quantum state?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000


24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A noisy quantum state.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000


26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, you can ask what's a noisy classical state?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the answer is, a noisy classical bit

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
might be 0 99% of the time and 1 1% of the time.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So it's some probability distribution

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
over values of the bit.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Noisy classical.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000


33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And this is the model used for analyzing

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
noisy classical channels and classical error

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
correcting codes.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000


37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And so we could try doing this.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000


39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So suppose you have a state.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000


41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You have a quantum state, which is

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
psi of i side with probability p of i.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And in one of your early problems sets,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
we actually looked at this.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, that's one definition of a noisy quantum state,

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but it's easier to use something called density matrices.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:33,000


48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So what this is called, this is an ensemble of quantum states.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000


50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So what is a density matrix, and why can we

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
use a density matrix rather than an ensemble of quantum states?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So corresponding to an ensemble of quantum states,

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we get a density matrix.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Density matrix.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000


56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the definition of a density matrix is row

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
equals summation p of i, psi by i, psi of i.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
