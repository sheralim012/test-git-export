0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
There's another channel.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'd like to discuss--

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the depolarizing channel.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Rho goes to rho plus--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
actually, let's make it 1 minus p rho plus p over 3 sigma

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
x rho sigma plus p over 3 sigma y rho sigma y plus p over 3

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
sigma z rho sigma z.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So with 1 minus p, you do nothing.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You apply the identity matrix.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000


11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Probability of p over 3, you apply each of the three Pauli

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
matrices.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000


14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So is there an easier formula for this?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Rho goes to, I guess, 1 minus 4/3 p rho plus identity.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000


18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And the reason for this is--

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000


20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:34,000
For any density matrix, rho plus sigma x rho sigma x plus sigma

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
y rho sigma y plus sigma z rho sigma z equals--

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000


24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OK, so this is completely unnormalized.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So we want this to be I over 2.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And we want this to be 1/4.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000


28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So with probability 1/4, we do nothing.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And probability 1/4, we apply sigma x.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
1/4, we apply segment y.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
1/4, we apply sigma z.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We get I over 2.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Proof-- well, let's call this thing sigma.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000


35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, sigma is a bad--

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's do tau.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sigma x tau sigma x equals sigma y tau sigma y equals

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
sigma z tau sigma z equals tau.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000


40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why is that?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, if we multiply this by sigma y in front and sigma y

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
behind, this gets taken to this sigma y.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This gets taken to rho.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sigma x rho sigma x gets taken to sigma z rho signal z.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And this gets taken to this.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So it's invariant.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000


48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is true of tau.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And now the only density matrix tau which has this property

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
is I over 2.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000


52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
OK, because let's say tau equals a, b, c, d.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000


54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sigma x tau sigma x equals b, d, a, c.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So a has to be equal to b.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sigma z tau sigma z equals a minus c minus d b.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
