00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The proof of this law will take us a little while,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but in the course of it we'll learn about the Clifford group

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and about code transformations in general.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So before I get into all of that,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
let me just argue about this point here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That if I multiply the code space by a unitary,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that's the same as rotating the stabilizer group in this way.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's remember we have Vs is a set of all psi such

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that g psi equals psi for all g in s.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So suppose we have UVs.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000


12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What can we say about this?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So this is the set of all U psi such that g

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
psi equals psi for all g in s.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So we just take everything in the code space

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and multiply it by a unitary.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now if we act on U psi with Ug U dagger,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
what's going to happen?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The U dagger U will cancel out.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
g acts trivially on psi.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we're left with Ug psi, which is just equal to U psi.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000


23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what this means is that UVs is stabilized by Ug U dagger

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
for all g in s.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000


26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And in fact, you can run the argument backwards,

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and you can argue that not only is this stabilized

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
by all of these elements, this is in fact

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the set of vectors which is stabilized

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
by all of these elements.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So UVs is equal to U--

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
sorry, V us u dagger.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000


34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So this gives us a powerful way of understanding

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
code transformations.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So to understand code transformations,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we can just act on S by conjugation.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Map S to Us U dagger.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I hope it's clear, this kind of set notation.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
U is a matrix, S is a set.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So what I mean by this is take every element of the set

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and multiply on the left by U and on the right by U dagger.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000


44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So my claim boils down to saying that for any stabilizer group

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
S, there exists U such that Us U dagger

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is equal to Z1 through Z n minus k.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000


48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And before I prove this, let me argue

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
why this should be plausible.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Or maybe another way of saying it is let me give you

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
a good way, a quick check, to make sure the statement is not

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
immediately absurd.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So one thing to know about when you conjugate by a unitary

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is a lot of things can change when

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you conjugate by a unitary.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But some things don't.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The eigen basis does not change.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry, the eigenvalues do not change.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The eigen basis will change.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The eigenvalues will remain the same.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So S is a group of polys.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Eigenvalues are all plus or minus 1.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Over here, eigenvalues are all plus or minus 1.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Good for that.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That should reassure us.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But the other thing which is a little more complicated

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that conjugation will not change is whether two vectors--

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
sorry, two matrices commute or anti-commute.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So if gh is equal to plus or minus hg,

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
then Ug U dagger Uh U dagger will equal plus or minus Uh U

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
dagger Uh U dagger.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000


73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So commutation relations should be preserved by this map.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
S contains all commuting operators.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The right hand side, also everything commutes.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So that's not sufficient necessarily,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but it should reassure us.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If that failed, then that would already

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
mean that such a transformation is impossible.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so doing these sanity checks can convince us

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that this claim is at least not immediately ruled out.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000


83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And what's surprising-- or I shouldn't tell you

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
what's surprising--

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
what may surprise you, which is, I think,

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
interesting, is that for polys, this is enough.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So it turns out that if I have some collection of polys,

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:26,000
P1 through Pk and Q1 through Qk have the same commutation

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
relations.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000


91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then there exists some U such that Qi

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is equal to U Pi U dagger.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000


94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So in other words, this is actually a generalization

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
of what I said.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What I said here is if I have a bunch of commuting polys,

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
then I can map them to whatever other set of commuting polys

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I please.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Here, I'm saying, actually, even if some of them

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
commute and some of them anti-commute,

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
as long as the new set has the same pattern of commuting

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and anti-commuting, then I can do this mapping.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000


104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I'm going to come back to this more formally later.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But it's worth thinking about what

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
this means in vector language.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So in the F2 picture, commuting or anti-commuting

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
just refers to their inner products.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So this says if I have a bunch of vectors

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and I know all their inner products

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and I have some other vectors and their inner products

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
all are the same--

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
vector 3 with vector 7, the inner product

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is the same in the first set or the second set.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then there is a transformation that

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
will map from one to the other.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So for real or complex vectors, this just

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
says if I have a bunch of vectors

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and their angles are such and such,

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
if I have two such sets there is a unitary

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
or an orthogonal matrix that will map me

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
from one to the other.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a basic fact about real and complex geometry.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And I'm just arguing the same thing is true for F2.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If I have a bunch of vectors with prescribed inner products,

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can map them to any other set of vectors with the same set

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
of inner products.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the way we'll do that math is with the Clifford group.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So that's the last thing I want to talk

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
about today is this set of transformations that map polys

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to polys.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I'll build up towards arguing that this is true.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
