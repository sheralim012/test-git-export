1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
With probability distributions, we

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
don't know what the state is.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But there is something else we take for granted,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is the basis.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So if I have a class system, there's

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
no possibility of superposition.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I just have some discrete states, which are all

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
perfectly distinguishable.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I can think about that as being a quantum system where

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've just fixed a basis, and I'm only

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
going to consider basis states.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I can say that classical state

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
x corresponds to quantum state ket x, where, let's say,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:55,000
1, 2 through d are some fixed orthonormal basis.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000


16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So this is a way in which quantum theory

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
can be thought of as generalizing

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
deterministic classical theory.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In other words, get rid of the superposition

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and then it looks classical.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can now take these quantum states

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and consider probability distributions over them.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So suppose I have state x with probability P sub x.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000


25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So if I have an ensemble where state ket 1 appears

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
with probability P1, ket with probability P2,

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ket d with probability P sub d, then

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can talk about the corresponding density matrix.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000


30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it simply looks like rho is sum from x

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is 1 to d Px ket x bra x.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And these are different orthonormal states.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So that just looks like writing the probability distribution,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the Ps, down the diagonal of some matrix

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and putting zeros on the off diagonal.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We can also write it in Matlab notation which is as diag of p.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So if you are not familiar with Matlab, if p is a vector,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
then diag of p creates a matrix with the entries of that vector

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
along the diagonal.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is actually overloaded and does other things too,

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but let's not worry about those.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OK, so it's a very simple prescription

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
for turning a probability distribution into a density

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
matrix.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just write it along the diagonal and add zeros everywhere else.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Just like for pure states, we're kind

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of adding more degrees of freedom that we're not using.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We have all these zeros in the matrix.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But that's the price, we pay for embedding

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
into a larger theory that is a simultaneous generalization

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
