00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you apply a measurement to a state, well, what do you get?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You get pi psi pi j psi over the absolute value

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of pi j, psi sub i.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000


5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
OK, so this is the jth outcome.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And you get it with probability pi sub j, psi sub i--

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the absolute value of this.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000


9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what happens when you apply a measurement from an ensemble?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:02,000


11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
OK, well, what you're going to get

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
is you're going to get pi sub j psi sub i--

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000


14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
oh, with probability absolute value squared.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sorry about the typo.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000


17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You get over pi sub j, psi sub pi with probability p sub i

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
times pi sub j, psi sub i squared.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000


20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So you start with a whole bunch of different quantum

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
states, each of which has some probability.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And you make a measurement, and you

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
get this term, the jth outcome for the ith

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
state in your ensemble with probability, which

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
is the product of the p sub i with pi sub j,

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
psi sub i squared.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So that's the probability of having the i state and then

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the probability of getting the jth outcome given

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
that you have the ith state.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's an extra squiggle in there.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sorry.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that is the probability that you have the i state

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and got the jth outcome.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So now we want to do is we want to say,

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
what is the ensemble of quantum states

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that we had when we got the jth outcome?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000


39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ensemble given jth outcome--

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000


41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
well, this is what you have there.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's exactly the same thing as we

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
have, pi j psi sub i over absolute value of pi sub j,

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
psi sub i.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And now you want to multiply it by this divided

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
by the probability of getting the jth outcome because what

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we're doing is we're conditioning on getting the jth

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
outcome.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So with probability, p i, i j, psi sub i squared

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
over the probability of jth outcome.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000


52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And the probability of the jth outcome is just this.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But I'm going to keep on writing it like this for a while.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000


55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So the corresponding ensemble--

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000


57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:51,000
well, we can divide 1 by probability of jth outcome.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000


59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And now we want to take the sum of this times--

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
no, ket of this and then bra of that.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So pi sub j psi sub i, psi sub i, pi sub j

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
divided by pi sub j, psi sub i.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And we want to square this because this term appears

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
in this ket and this bra.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And now we need to multiply it by this.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
p sub i, pi sub j, psi sub i squared.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000


68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OK, so everyone should notice that this cancels that.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000


70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So this is equal to--

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
well, 1 over the probability of the jth outcome was just that.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So 1 over trace pi sub j, rho.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000


74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I want to say we have a sum p i, psi sub i inside.

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So that is just pi sub j sum p sub i, psi i, psi i, pi sub j.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000


77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is equal to 1 over trace pi sub j, rho, pi sub j, rho pi sub j.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:12,000


79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You take this, and you divide it by its trace.

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So you get a matrix of trace 1.

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000


82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So now I'm going to tell you something maybe I should of

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
started telling you.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Maybe I should have told you earlier.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000


86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And this is, of course, with probability trace pi j, rho.

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
