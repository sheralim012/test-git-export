0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what about the classical random maps?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So here we have some of the constraints

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of quantum mechanics.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In particular, if you're going to act

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
on probability distributions, the math should be linear.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And so we're going to map a vector

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
T to some other vector, which is a linear function of P.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so we can write that in terms of a matrix, T.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And not any just any matrix will if possible here.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000


12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The output has to still be a probability distribution.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In particular, it has to have non-negative entries,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and it has to be normalized.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And that has to be true regardless of the input vector

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
P, just like we saw for unitaries.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You know, unitaries are something

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that preserves the length of all vectors.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's not enough to have a matrix that preserves

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the length of some vectors.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You need a matrix that preserves the length of any unit vector.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Likewise, for these matrices, t.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And the ones that satisfy this are called stochastic.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000


25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So let's talk briefly about the properties

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of stochastic matrices.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000


28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's important that we're going to

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a simultaneous generalization soon of stochastic and unitary.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we should make sure that we're

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
rock solid on both of these corners

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
before we move into this final box.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So what does a stochastic matrix look like?

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's think about what it comes from.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So in a deterministic theory, if you're in state x,

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you have to transition deterministically

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to some other state.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But in a random theory, if you're in state x,

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you could transition with some probabilities

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to many different output states.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So let's say that the probability of seeing output y

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
conditioned on input x.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can write that out a little more,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:37,000
probability of final state y given initial state x.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000


46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So these are a bunch of numbers.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me put them into this matrix, T.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So once I have this matrix, T, you

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
can see that the probability of output y

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
is the sum over x of the probability of input

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
x and the probability of this transition.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This first one is P sub x.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The second one is T sub yx.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And so what we have is the y entry of this vector T times p.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So this is justifying why matrix multiplication

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is the right way of doing probabilistic transitions.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I haven't said anything about the form of the matrix T yet,

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but this is how we derive that randomized maps should

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
look like.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This probabilities go to a matrix times that vector

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
of probabilities.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So let me let me leave up this set of boxes.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000


64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So the operation is linear, and so that's

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
how we get a matrix t in the first place.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But as you said, the entries of t

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we can say a little bit more about.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The entries of t correspond to probabilities

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
of some event happening.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so from this derivation we get that each individual entry

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is non-negative.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000


74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Be careful, by the way, I use greater than

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or equal than to mean--

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
if I'm using it as a matrix, I mean the matrix

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is positive semidefinite.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Here I'm just talking about the number,

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that yx entry of the matrix t is a non-negative number.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It should always be clear from context

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
if there's a matrix or a number on the left hand side,

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but beware that it's the same symbol.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So we have that constraint.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can derive this from the fact

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that this came from probabilities,

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but you can also derive it a little more axiomatically.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If I'm going to map random states to random states,

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I better have this, or I'm going to leave

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
my set of valid probability distributions, right?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because if I have T, and I act on--

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
let me define e sub x to be 001 where the 1 is in the x

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
position.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is kind of like the classical version of cat x.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then Tex is sum over y Tyx ey.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
e sub x is a valid probability distribution, corresponds

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to just deterministically being in state x.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
T times e sub x should be also a valid probability distribution,

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
so all of these had better be non-negative.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And so that implies that every single entry of the matrix

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
should be a non-negative real number.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OK.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So that gives us a constraint.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But there is another constraint that we also get from that.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's the other constraint we get?

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000


106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This sums to 1.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So we also get that for all x, the sum over y of Tyx

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is equal to 1.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So the columns of the matrix sum to 1.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So when we say stochastic, that's what we mean.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We mean the entries are non-negative,

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and the column sum to 1.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000


114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And these operations can also destroy information.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So unitarians do not.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's a unique feature of unitary time evolution.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
