1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me talk about the Stinespring representation

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of channels.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
By the way, I'm writing operations,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but I'm saying channels.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I mix these up in my head because we often

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
talk about a quantum channel as something that

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
takes an input in one place and maps it

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as an output to somewhere else.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's exactly the same thing as a quantum operation.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The two words that mean the same thing.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So one way of thinking about quantum operations

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is to go back to the Schrodinger equation.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the Schrondinger equation says

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that all dynamics in the universe are unitary.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000


16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So physical dynamics are unitary.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000


18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In other words, if you have a state psi, it evolves to U psi

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you have the outer product of psi with itself,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the ket evolves with the U acting on it

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
at the left, the bra with a dagger on the right.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So a density matrix in general evolves like this.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this is what the Schrodinger equation says.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a crucial feature of quantum theory

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that it does not destroy information.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There is now-- or create information.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The amount of information is preserved.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There are people searching for maybe exceptions

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to this that might arise with general relativity

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in black holes.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But in general, in ordinary circumstances,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we think that quantum mechanics does not create or destroy

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
information.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So this looks like the end of the story.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's what we have for pure states.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Maybe it should be the same for density matrices.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But when you're working with physical systems in the lab,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
or in trying to build a quantum computer,

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we observe things all the time that do not look unitary.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the reason is, this is true for a closed system.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000


42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But we often bring in a new system

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that we haven't previously been considering,

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or we throw away part of the system

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that we had been looking at.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So if we add a system, this looks

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
like tensoring on a new state.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or if we discard a subsystem, let's say

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
our original state was defined on systems A and B,

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
then we perform the partial trace

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and discard one of the subsystems.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We can write this as rho A. And if you

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
haven't seen the explicit formula for this,

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
it involves applying the trace map just

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to the second of the two systems.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So we could write this as sum over

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
a basis for system B of identity on A, tensor ket B on system B,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
row AB identity on system A. Sorry, this is bra B

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and this is ket B on system B. So this

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
corresponds to discarding one of two systems.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Another way we can write it is as the identity map

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:02,000
on system A, tensor the trace map on system B.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So these are all ways of describing

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
what happens when we have a composite system

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and we throw away part of it.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000


67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just a note about the formalism.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When I write-- these maps I'm considering are in general maps

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
from density matrices to density matrices.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I'll define a little bit of notation.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000


72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So let's say that A and B are vector spaces.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
These are where the states live.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me define L of A, L of B to be linear operators on A or B.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So these are linear operators or matrices on these systems.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So a density matrix would live in this space L of A or L of B.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And what we're looking at are maps that take density matrices

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
to other density matrices.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So you could view these-- actually,

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll define one more thing.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So L of A, B is linear operators from A to B.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And so if we define L of L of A, L of B,

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that means linear operators from L of A to L of B.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So you take in a matrix on system A,

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and you output a matrix on system B.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
These are sometimes called superoperators, a physics

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
versus math perspective.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The math perspective is these are all just operators.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They just operate on different vector spaces.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A more physicist way of saying it

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is that you have vectors, and then operators,

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and then superoperators, and there's more of a hierarchy.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They're both valid ways of thinking about it

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that you will encounter in different settings.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So with the partial traces is a linear map

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
from density matrices on A tensor B

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to density matrices only on system A.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So the input is a density matrix on systems A and B,

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the output is a density matrix just on system B.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So hopefully, that makes all these equations--

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
makes it clear what systems we're acting on.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And so in this final line here, when

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I write identity sub-A what I mean

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
is the identity superoperator, the identity that

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
takes a matrix on system A and spits out

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the same matrix on system A.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What about the trace map on system B?

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So the input of this is L of B, operators,

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
matrices on system B. What is the output--

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
what space is in the output of the trace map?

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000


112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I heard some-- yeah?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Complex numbers?

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Complex numbers.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Exactly.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So the trace takes a matrix here on system B

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and spits out just a complex number.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so I don't write L of A tensor product complex numbers,

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
because tensoring on just a one-dimensional space

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
doesn't do anything.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But that's effectively what I have here.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so we have this part leaves A alone.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
