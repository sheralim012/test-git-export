1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I claim that tpcp maps have Kraus decompositions.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In other words, this picture of quantum channels

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is not more general than what we've

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
done before, it's equivalent.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The channels you've done before, this-- the way

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we have to find channel so far, we have given two definitions.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
One, isometry partial trace.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two, cross decomposition.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've shown those are equivalent.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a third definition.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Also, equivalent.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000


13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And I will not fully prove that in lecture, I'll

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
just prove one direction of it, kind

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of the easy direction of it.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I'll leave the other direction for the homework.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the easy direction is that if n of RHO has the Kraus form,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
then n is trace-preserving and completely positive.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000


20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, first off, we should check, of course, clearly, n

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
is linear, and hermiticy-- hermiticity preserving

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is also not too hard.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So if we take n of RHO dagger, then this is sum over e.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We just reverse this and dagger every term.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So we do ve dagger, dagger, which gives us just ve.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We have RHO dagger, and then we have ve dagger.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But if RHO is Hermitian, then RHO is equal to RHO dagger,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and so now this is just ve RHO, ve dagger,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which is the same as what we started with.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is just end of RHO.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is if RHO equals RHO dagger.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So you put in Hermitian input, you get a Hermitian output.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000


34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So what about trace-preserving and completely positive?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You'll notice so far we've used no properties of Kraus

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
operators, right?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have these Kraus operator conditions,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
those haven't been used.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So we should expect them to be used at some point.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000


41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So for trace-preserving, let's compute the trace of n of RHO.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So this is the sum over e--

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
sorry, trace of the sum over e of ve RHO, ve dagger.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000


45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So what should you do whenever you see a trace of things?

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If it's not obvious how to proceed, which-- what should

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you try doing?

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000


49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, actually there are two things you could try.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
One of them is try a different-- try a basis.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The other one is cyclic property of the trace.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, here, I don't know what to do about the basis

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so let's try the other one.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is trace sum over e.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And you could cycle the ve over there

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
or the ve dagger over here.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Doesn't make a big difference.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The purpose of doing this is now the ve terms are together,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
along with the sum, I group them together,

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and what's this thing in the parenthesis?

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What's that?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Identity one, yes.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So because of the cross operative condition.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, finally, I used them.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That should reassure me that I had to use them somewhere.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I get trace RHO.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's what trace-preserving means, trace of the output

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
equals trace of the input.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
