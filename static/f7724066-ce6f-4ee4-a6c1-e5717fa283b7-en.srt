1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When you have an ensemble of quantum states,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
it means that you have some quantum state

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with some probability, some other state

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with some other probability.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is really the proper way of combining randomness

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with quantumness, when you have the generalization

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of both probability and quantum mechanics.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And when you say it like that, it

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
sounds like you have an unimaginably large--

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in fact, an uncountable number of degrees of freedom.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So an ensemble, if I write it out, looks like this.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I have some probabilities P sub x and some states.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I said x, such that the Px are a valid probability distribution

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the psi x are unit vectors.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if you ask about how many ensembles are there,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
there is a vast number, an uncountable number.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We started with bits.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If d is 2, we just have bits.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For both probabilities or quantum states,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we have two dimensional vector spaces.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And ensembles, now we have this infinite number

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of degrees of freedom.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So it's in a sense, the right operational way

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to think about it.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it's somehow over complete.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're using too much information.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And so the key idea of density matrices

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is that this is more information than you need.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And the reason is that if you have an observable,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it doesn't depend completely generally on psi x.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It only depends on it as a linear function of ket

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
psi x and a linear function of bra psi x.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So an observable M has expectation bra psi

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
x and ket psi x, which you could write as trace of M ket psi

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
x, bra psi x.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so the dependence of observables on this date

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is not fully general.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They only depend as linear functions of this ket

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
psi x, bra psi x.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So if I have an ensemble of quantum states,

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't need to worry about arbitrary moments

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
of that ensemble.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In principle, I could have needed

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to worry about the seventh moment or the 15th moment.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is sort of like the second moment.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's like a degree 2 polynomial of the entries of psi x.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just knowing the expectations of those

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
is enough to tell me about all of the expectations.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And so from this ensemble, all I need to know

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is the density matrix rho equals sum over x Px psi x psi x.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000


52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So if I have an ensemble of quantum states

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and I want to know about every possible expectation

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
value of that ensemble, I don't need

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to write down the infinite number of degrees

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
of freedom of that ensemble.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's enough just to write down this D by D matrix.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
