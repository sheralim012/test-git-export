00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OK, so what kinds of matrices can be density matrices?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A density matrix is trace 1 positive semidefinite

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and Hermitian.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000


5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And, in, fact all Hermitian positive semidefinite trace 1

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
matrices are density matrices.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000


8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So summation p's of i, psi of i, psi of i, tracing this.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000


10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This matrix, psi i, psi i, has trace 1

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because the normal psi is 1.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So this is equal to sum p of i trace psi i, psi

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
i equals sum pi equals 1.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000


15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OK, positive semidefinite.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OK, so here you need to know something

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
about positive semidefinite matrices, which

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know if I have proved, but I'm not going to.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm just going to tell you.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So if you have two positives semidefinite matrices

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you add them, you get another positive semidefinite

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
matrix.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So positive semidefinite permission

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
means all eigenvalues are greater than or equal to 0.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000


26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So this matrix has one eigenvalue of 1

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and all the rest are 0, and the eigenvalue

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is, of course, psi of i.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So it's positive semidefinite.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So its sum, and you're adding a bunch of them--

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so the sum is also positive semidefinite.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's Hermitian, which means its conjugate is

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
its transpose, because each of these is Hermitian.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we've shown that any density matrix

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is trace 1 positive semidefinite permission.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But the other way around holds as well.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000


38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If m is Hermitian, then m is equal to summation lambda i

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
equals 1 through d, lambda i vi vi, where the v's of i

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
are eigenvectors.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000


42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
First, all the vi's are perpendicular,

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
so you can easily see that vi is an eigenvalue of this matrix

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
with--

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
eigenvalue of lambda i.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And, in fact, that's the unique matrix,

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which has eigenvectors v's of i with eigenvalues lambda i.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Eigenvalues.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000


50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So a matrix is a density matrix if, and only if, it's

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
positive semidefinite permission trace 1.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
