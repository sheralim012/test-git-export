0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now I want to explain how we come up with this

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and give you a formula for it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Measure trace on a.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Measure a in-- well, it doesn't matter which basis

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you measure a in.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But let's say canonical basis.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000


8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you get what you get when you measure

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a in a canonical basis as you get probability

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
distribution on pure states.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000


12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So here, I suppose I should have said we're assuming

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you start with a pure state.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When you measure a in the canonical basis,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you get a probability distribution on pure states.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And this probability distribution

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
corresponds to a density matrix, which is exactly taking

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the trace of the first qubit.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:19,000


20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we can write psi sub ab as equal

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to summation alpha i, e sub i.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the ith--

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000


24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
this is the ith basis element, w sub i.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And this is whatever we get when we write psi ab like this.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So when you get these measurements,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you get a probability distribution on pure states.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this corresponds to a diagonal density matrix, right?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000


31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000


33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe I should do a better example.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK, let's make up an example.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000


36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's say 1 over root 3, 0, 0 plus 0, 1 plus 1, 1.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000


38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
OK, measure first qubit.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000


40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The measurement outcome-- well, we

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
get 0 with probability of 2/3.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the residual state, if we get 0, is just 1

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
over root 2, 0 plus 1.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000


45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And measure-- we get an outcome of 1 with a probability of 1/3.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And the state is just one in that case.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:36,000


48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So the density matrix is 2/3 times 1 over root 2, 0

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:09,000
plus 1, 0 plus 1 plus 1/3, 1, 1, which equals 2/3, 1, 1, 1, 1--

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
except I'd better put a 1/2 here--

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000


52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
plus 1/3, 0, 0, 0, 1 is equal to--

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
let's see.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that's 1/3, 1, 1, 2/3.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000


56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, 1/3, 1/3, 2/3.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000


58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OK.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000


60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now the density matrix of that thing is 1/3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1,

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And we're tracing out the first qubit, which means

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
we need to add this plus this.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Trace A, you get 1, 1, 1, 2 because what you're doing

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
is you're just adding this matrix and this matrix.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000


67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And let's put a 1/3 in for normalization.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is equal to that.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah?

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So when you say you're getting a probability

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
distribution on pure states, you mean pure states of A.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, if you trace out A, you're getting pure states of B.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But, yeah.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you measure A, you get a probability distribution

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:20,000
on pure states of B because here we measured the first qubit.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And if we measured the first qubit as 0, we got this on B.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And if we measure the first qubit as 1, we got this on B.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But the top one's not a pure state of B.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, a pure state of AB.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you have a pure state of a joint system.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You measure one of the systems.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And this gives you a probability distribution

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
on the states of the other system.

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And these pure states turn into a density matrix

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
in the way we make density matrices out

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of probabilistic ensembles of pure states.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But they also correspond to this partial trace operation.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And here, I'm not going to trace B would

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
be equal to trace of this guy.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's 2.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Trace of that guy, that's 1, 1, 1 with a 1/3 in front of it.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And if you look at that state, if you

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
interchange 1 and 0 and the two qubits, you get the same thing.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000


95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So if you start with this and interchange the two qubits,

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you get this.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So that would give you exactly the same calculation

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
for this with 0 and 1 changed.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:16,000


100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So this is what happens.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So psi sub A is equal to--

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you can always write a state of two systems

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
as a probabilistic superimposition on ei,

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the canonical basis in the one times some vector in the other.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And that's because that is equal to 1 over root 3, 0, 0 plus 1

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:07,000
over, I guess, root 2 over 3, 0 over root 2 plus 1 over root 3,

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
1 times 1.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So 0 and 1 are these e sub i.

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And this and this are the w sub i.

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And the probabilities are these things squared.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And those are the alpha i.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000


113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So trace A on psi AB is equal to some alpha i squared w, i,

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
w, i.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000


116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And w, i is equal to I guess partial inner product of e

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
sub i on A with psi AB.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, wait.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, I want to say alpha i, wi is this inner product

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because it's not normalized.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So rho is going to be equal to summation

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
alpha i squared wi, wi.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to say this is summation over i,

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:40,000
e sub i, bra e sub i, ket psi bra psi ket e sub i.

125
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
