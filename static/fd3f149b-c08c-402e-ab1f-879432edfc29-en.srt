0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Bloch sphere.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000


3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Remember the bloch sphere was a way

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of encoding, of visualizing, pure states on--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000


6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm drawing this really badly.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
OK.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's try this.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000


10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have 0 here.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
0 up at the top.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
0 plus 1 over root 2 equals plus here.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
1 at the bottom minus.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And at the back we had 0 plus I 1 over root 2.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And the front we had 0 minus I 1 over root 2.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000


17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So there's a way of extending this

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to density matrices on qubits.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:29,000


20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And the center of the sphere is 1/2, 1/2 of 0, 0.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000


22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So that's the completely random state.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what happens, intuitively, is you have pure states

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
on the outside of this ball.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And as you make them more and more mixed states, as you add,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
as you get them closer to the center, you get that.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000


28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And-- so you can always write any 2 by 2 density matrix.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000


30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can always write rho equals I

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:48,000
plus r dot sigma over 2, where r is in or on the unit ball.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So it's somewhere inside the bloch sphere.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
r [? on-- ?] r equals 1.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If and only if rho corresponds to a pure state.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000


36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So the points on the surface of the sphere of the bloch sphere

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
correspond to pure states.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And as they get more and more mixed,

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you go into towards the center.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And this is a way of visualizing all density matrices

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
on two qubits.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,000


43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Suppose r-- suppose rho is pure.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000


45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Rho is going to be equal to--

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000


47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
well, we have two eigenvectors.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
One of them has--

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000


50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
umm.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OK.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000


53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Rho equals psi psi.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:05:14,000


55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Remember 0.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The point on the bloch sphere--

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000


58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:37,000
point on bloch sphere corresponding to rho is--

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
well, remember it was the operator corresponding to psi.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Which is psi psi minus psi bar psi bar.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,000


62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I think that's right.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So rho is equal to--

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000


67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
so that's r dot sigma for a point in the bloch sphere.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:48,000
rho is equal to psi psi plus minus psi bar, psi bar over 2

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:03,000
plus I. But I is just equal to psi psi plus psi bar psi bar.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because if you take two orthogonal states

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and look at their density matrix,

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
well, their density matrix is I over 2

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but I is psi psi plus are psi bar,

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
psi bar, which is equal to psi, psi.

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000


76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So if rho is pure, then the point

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
on a bloch sphere corresponding to rho

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is indeed r dot sigma, where r is a unit vector.

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And as you add--

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and any density matrix can be a density matrix--

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
any density metric can be represented this way.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not going to have time to prove it.

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But it's-- I've shown that when rho is a pure state.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I've shown that for the identity matrix, which

85
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is the maximally mixed state.

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And this just interpolates between them.

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So that is how 2 by 2 density matrices

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
work on the bloch sphere.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
