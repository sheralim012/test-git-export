00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Why is it true that this is all we need to consider?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Because, technically, we should be looking

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
at compositions of these.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you allow me to do isometry then partial trace,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
isometry, partial trace, isometry, partial

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
trace, over and over again.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then you should believe that I can

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
get all possible compositions of the three elements.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But here I'm saying I only do it once.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the reason is--

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
let's just consider if we do it twice.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's consider n2 composed with n1.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We start with a system a, we do some isometry v1,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we get output b, and e1 goes into the trash can.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then we feed it to a second isometry, v2, as output c.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000


17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
e2 gets discarded.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So this is what the combination of these two channels

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
looks like.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I claim-- so the key thing about this is,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
these discardings--

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
after I discard a system, by definition

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I never look at it again.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The photon leaves my lab or otherwise becomes

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
inaccessible to me.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Or maybe it's still there, but I just promise never

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to touch it again.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Either way, I'm not going to act on it ever again.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So it doesn't matter if I discard it right away

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
or I keep it around and I discarded at end.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So if I write this as a goes into the composition of v2

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
with v1, then what do I get?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I get output c e1 e2.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then I can push all the discarding to the end.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So now I trace out both e1 and e2,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I get back to the same map.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you may have heard of the principle

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
of deferred measurement which says

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can always push measurements to the end of a quantum

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
computation.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is similar.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You could call it a principle of deferred partial trace.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If I do a partial trace in the middle,

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I could have always done it at the end as well.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So partial trace can always be delayed.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In fact, because partial trace is only a bookkeeping device,

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can delay it forever.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So there's a philosophy called the Church of the Larger

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hilbert Space, which says if I'm only going to consider, let's

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
say, a measurement on system c, I could have traced out e1

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and e2, or I could have kept them around

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and considered myself to have an overall pure state.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And that means, in other words, looking at my system

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
as living in a larger Hilbert Space.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And it's just as good.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can describe measurements on c just as well.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In some cases it's more convenient to trace out

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
e1 and e2 and just consider the reduced state on system c.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In some cases, it's more convenient to consider

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the overall pure state that includes the environment.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And these are both equally valid ways of doing it.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The only tiebreaker between them should

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
be convenience and simplicity of the calculation.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But physically, they describe the same system.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So because I can always defer partial trace, any sequence

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
of isometries in partial trace, I

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
can represent as a single isometry followed

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
by a single partial trace.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so that justifies why this is a valid description

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
