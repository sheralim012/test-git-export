1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's talk about the F2 picture of the Clifford group.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000


3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So remember that if U is in the Clifford group

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
what that means is that--

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and P is some poly, then U P U dagger is some other poly.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So that's what it means for U to be in the Clifford group.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000


8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And remember, also, that if a and b are vectors,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
f in F2 of length n, we can write v

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to be the vector obtained by just stacking them

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
on top of each other.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a vector in F2 to the 2n.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And we can define the corresponding poly

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to be x to the a times z to the b.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to ignore the phase for now.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You'd also have a plus or minus sign in general.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we can ask, what does U sigma v U dagger look like?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OK, so we know sigma of the V, apart from the phase,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is pretty much a fully general poly.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we know this is some other poly matrix.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so we can write this.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And what that poly matrix is, of course,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
will depend on V as well as U.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we can write this as minus 1 to the f of V times sigma

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to the g of V, where f and g are some functions that

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
depend on U. So when you want to say, how does the Clifford

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
group act on polys, it maps polys to other polys,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it will do so via these functions.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
For every unitary, there are some functions, f and g,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
that describe how it maps polys to other polys.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000


32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And now, what I'd like to do is figure out which of these

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
functions are allowed and which are not,

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because we cannot have fully--

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
these are not-- any Clifford can be

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
described in terms these functions, but not vice versa.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There is clearly choices of the functions

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that would not make any sense.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
For example, of g of V were always 0,

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
then that would mean that sigma--

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we don't have sigma to the 0, which is just the identity.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it would mean that if you conjugate any poly,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you get the identity, maybe plus or minus identity.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That wouldn't be possible, because we

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
know that conjugation preserves the eigenvalues So this has

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
half its eigenvalues plus 1, half its eigenvalues minus 1,

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
unless V itself is 0.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And so the right-hand side had better also

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
have eigenvalues plus or minus 1.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And in fact, there are many stronger conditions on f and g

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that we'll derive.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
