        "The second one, OK, maybe a classical Turing machine", 
        "wouldn't use a unitary oracle, but you",

        "you could view as combining-- you could say,",

        "right?", 
        "So in model two, my input is not--",

        "I get sort of a black box that prepares the input.", 
        "In model three, I get the whole input, but it's quantum.",

        "is to get a black box that is quantum.",

        "And so, you know, you're given black box access to U,",

        "boy, I've really used the last scraps of space here.",
