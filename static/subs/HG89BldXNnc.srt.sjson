        "is what the classical codes do, they", 
        "correct for arbitrary single bit errors.", 
        "But here, we have to correct both phase and bit value", 
        "errors.", 
        "And Shor 9-qubit code was the very first to ever do that.", 
        "And when he came out with it, it was beautiful and obvious", 
        "why it worked, but people didn't have a theory of why it worked", 
        "and what it is a member of a family for.", 
        "And I'll get a little into that when", 
        "we see the conditions for quantitative error correction.",

        "OK.",

        "Y6.", 
        "Y6.", 
        "Right.", 
        "Great.",

        "So Y6 is a product of Z6 and X6, so you can think", 
        "that both errors occurred.", 
        "Now, that X6 is clearly going to change this operator", 
        "here and not this operator.",

        "But the X6 is going to commute with all of these.",

        "", 
        "And so the Z6 is going to trigger the X1,",

        "I'm missing one, too.", 
        "Right?",
