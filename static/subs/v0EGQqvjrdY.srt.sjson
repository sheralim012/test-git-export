        "of overlaps of the z's in the new word with x's here--", 
        "that should be even.",

        "Or you could just--", 
        "I could just tell you a vector.", 
        "And you can verify that it works.", 
        "And so, to do it the quick way, I'll", 
        "tell you that one vector that's in it is the 5x operator.", 
        "So if I take a string of all x's, you", 
        "can see, for every one of these cyclically shifted codewords,", 
        "it's going to commute with the x's in it.", 
        "And there are two z's.", 
        "So, two z's means inner product of zero.", 
        "1 plus 1 here is 0.",

        "So, for the same reason, the 5z operator is in n of s.", 
        "And these are not members of s, because, however I multiply", 
        "these together, I'm going to have an even number", 
        "of x's and z's.", 
        "And these have an odd number.", 
        "So I can write n of s as being generated", 
        "by the stabilizers, plus these two additional operators.", 
        "", 
        "And these operators-- so what do they do?", 
        "They commute with everything in the stabilizer set,", 
        "which means that they map this subspace to itself.", 
        "So, if I take one of these operators,", 
        "and I act on this subspace, I'm going", 
        "to map it back to the subspace.", 
        "But that doesn't mean that I fix every single vector in it,", 
        "right.", 
        "So the stabilizers fix every single vector in this subspace.", 
        "Any vector you have here, the stabilizers will act trivially.",

        "within the subspace.", 
        "In general, they will change the vectors within the subspace.", 
        "And so we can define--", 
        "so, I haven't told you what zero bar and one bar are.", 
        "We can just define them to be eigenstates of these operators.",

        "Before we go on, we should note that they anti-commute, right,", 
        "because they overlap in an odd number of places.", 
        "So they, really, in that sense, are", 
        "polys that look like x and z.", 
        "And, with these in hand, after having to find these,", 
        "we can just choose zero bar and one bar to be the eigenstates--",
