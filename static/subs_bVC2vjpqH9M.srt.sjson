    "And each one of these happens with a different amplitude,",

    "For the statistical mixtures we have written here", 
    "using this circle plus as an or sign, the density", 
    "matrix is defined as the sum over the outer product of each",

    "are given by the outer products, so 0", 
    "is 1 0 0 0, and 1 is 0 0 0 1.", 
    "The cross term 0 1 has the 1 in the upper right hand corner.", 
    "And this is easy to understand by labeling the rows", 
    "and columns appropriately, with 0 on the left and on the top.", 
    "", 
    "You may also explicitly multiply the column and row vector",

    "by this sum.", 
    "3/4 of 1 and 1/4 of 1 gives you 1/4 times 3 0 0 1.", 
    "The second statistical mixture is", 
    "where we need the cross terms because the states are", 
    "superpositions.", 
    "These cross terms give rise to off-diagonal elements",

    "Summing, as before, we find, though,", 
    "something very interesting.", 
    "The result is the same density matrix as for Mixture 1.", 
    "We conclude from this that the two are actually", 
    "the same state.", 
    "More about this can be understood", 
    "by returning to the formalism of density matrices.", 
    "Let me begin by defining a density matrix.", 
    "A density matrix is a matrix rho which", 
    "has two particular properties.", 
    "First, the trace of rho must equal 1.", 
    "Second, the density matrix rho must be positive.", 
    "In other words, for all possible states that one might choose,", 
    "the expectation value of rho must be real and greater than", 
    "or equal to 0.", 
    "How do I construct a density matrix from states?", 
    "First, let me make this claim, that a density matrix may", 
    "be constructed from a probabilistic combination", 
    "of pure states.", 
    "P, here, is a probability.", 
    "Psi are states which for now let us take to be orthogonal.", 
    "We may prove that this statistical combination", 
    "is a density matrix by checking the two constraints.", 
    "First, we note that its trace is equal to 1,", 
    "since Ps are probabilities.", 
    "And second, it is clear that the matrix is positive.", 
    "So we can construct density matrices this way.", 
    "In the reverse direction, given a density matrix,", 
    "how can we interpret it?", 
    "Well, I claim that any density matrix", 
    "rho can be expressed as a stochastic combination", 
    "of pure states.", 
    "So that is exactly in the form we", 
    "have just seen, using a stochastic combination", 
    "of pure states.", 
    "Let us prove this claim as follows.", 
    "A density matrix is positive, and thus it", 
    "has a spectral decomposition into eigenvalues", 
    "and eigenvectors.", 
    "And this spectral decomposition gives us exactly what we want.", 
    "We may see this straightforwardly", 
    "by writing out the spectral decomposition with lambda sub k", 
    "being the eigenvalue for state k.", 
    "Note that the trace is 1, and thus the eigenvalues", 
    "must sum to 1, meaning they are a probability distribution.", 
    "They are also real-valued, and rho", 
    "is positive by construction.", 
    "This decomposition-- known as an unraveling--", 
    "allows us to consider some useful definitions.", 
    "Rho is known as being pure when its decomposition results", 
    "in a single pure state alone.", 
    "Otherwise, rho is known as being a mixed state,", 
    "meaning that it is a stochastic combination", 
    "of multiple pure states.", 
    "OK, given these two constructions", 
    "let's consider a quick question.", 
    "How about a stochastic combination of density", 
    "matrices, given Ps as probabilities and rhos", 
    "as density matrices.", 
    "Is this combination a legal density matrix?",
