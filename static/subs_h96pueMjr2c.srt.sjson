    "", 
    "then g times pi s is equal to pi s.",

    "So that proves this fact that if I", 
    "multiply pi s on the left by g, I get back pi s.", 
    "Now you're absolutely right.", 
    "We have no idea what pi s is.", 
    "Other than the sum, we just know one property of it.", 
    "", 
    "So what do we do with this fact?", 
    "So what that implies--", 
    "is-- if g is in s--", 
    "", 
    "G dagger is in s.", 
    "And so G dagger pi s is also equal to pi s--", 
    "right.", 
    "G is closed under inverses.", 
    "These elements are all unitary.", 
    "And so in particular, if I have one G dagger", 
    "and multiply on the left by pi s.", 
    "If I average over a bunch of them, the same thing is true.", 
    "So in particular, pi s dagger times pi s is equal to pi s.", 
    "So I've just replaced the G dagger here", 
    "with an average over all of the G daggers.", 
    "In other words, with pi s dagger.", 
    "", 
    "OK?", 
    "", 
    "Now this last equation tells us that pi s is a projector.", 
    "So why is that?", 
    "Well, if you're of this form, you must be Hermitian.", 
    "In fact, you must be positive semidefinite.", 
    "In fact, all of your eigenvalues should have the property", 
    "that when you square them, you get back the same eigenvalue.", 
    "Now what numbers squared equal themselves?", 
    "The only options are 0 and 1.", 
    "So from this equation, you know that all", 
    "of the eigenvalues of pi s are 0 and 1 and that it's Hermitian.", 
    "So that means it's a projector onto something.", 
    "The only debate now is what does it project onto?", 
    "Does it, in fact, project onto V sub s?", 
    "OK?", 
    "So therefore, the eigenvalues of pi s are all 0, 1.", 
    "", 
    "So the only question is what does this project onto?", 
    "So let's suppose you have pi s times some arbitrary state, Cy.", 
    "And we multiply by g for sum.", 
    "So g is in s.", 
    "", 
    "Cy Is arbitrary.", 
    "What can we say about this equation--", 
    "about this expression?", 
    "What does that equal to?", 
    "", 
    "Yeah?", 
    "You're pointing--", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "", 
    "Right, you're saying it satisfies the stabilizer", 
    "equation.", 
    "It's unaffected by g.", 
    "So we know that g times pi s is equal to pi s.", 
    "So this is equal to pi s Cy.", 
    "So if you put parentheses here, this vector is stabilized by g.", 
    "So therefore, pi s Cy is in Vs. In other words, the image of pi", 
    "s is contained in Vs On the other hand,", 
    "if Cy already belongs to Vs, then", 
    "all of the g's act trivially.", 
    "So then-- when we apply pi s to it,", 
    "all these g's just act like identity.", 
    "And so we get back Cy.", 
    "So this means that Vs is contained in the image of pi s.", 
    "So finally, we have that pi s projects onto a projector.", 
    "And its image is exactly equal to the space that we want.", 
    "So, therefore, pi s is equal to the projector", 
    "onto Vs. Any questions about this argument?", 
    "", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "Can you explain why is dagger into the s?", 
    "Why G dagger's an s?", 
    "S is a group, so it contains its inverses.", 
    "And the elements of s are all unitary.", 
    "So their inverses are just given by their daggers.", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "", 
    "That's right.", 
    "Yeah, nothing in my argument used the fact", 
    "that s was a polygroup.", 
    "This is a totally general fact about groups.", 
    "Why is g [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "OK, so I guess I don't want to address the general group", 
    "situation.", 
    "There's one thing I'm sort of conflating which", 
    "is the elements of a group with some unitary representation", 
    "of them.", 
    "So, really, what I should say is this works", 
    "for any subgroup of unitaries.", 
    "", 
    "Good.", 
    "Any other questions?", 
    "", 
    "OK, so why did we do this?", 
    "I mean, it's nice to have a deal with a calculate projector.", 
    "Here's one immediate thing we get from this.", 
    "So-- let's try to calculate the dimension of the stabilizer", 
    "subspace.", 
    "", 
    "If you look at that definition up there,", 
    "it looks pretty complicated, right.", 
    "It depends on the intersection of all these", 
    "plus 1 eigenspaces.", 
    "Who knows how they intersect.", 
    "It was what I said before.", 
    "Do they always have to cut each other in half or not?", 
    "But now that I have a formula for the projector,", 
    "I can just say, this is equal to the trace of the projector.", 
    "Because the trace if it's 0's and 1's, this will just count", 
    "the number of 1's-- the number of dimensions.", 
    "And trace is linear, so this is just average over s--", 
    "sum over g and s--", 
    "trace g.", 
    "", 
    "So-- now-- this seems a little tough", 
    "because s is a general group.", 
    "But what can I say about the trace of a polymatrix?", 
    "", 
    "It's 0-- mostly 0.", 
    "When is it not 0?", 
    "The identity.", 
    "So the only time it's non 0 is if it's the identity.", 
    "So if this giant sum--", 
    "but we don't care about most of it.", 
    "We only care about a single term which", 
    "is the identity, which has trace 2 to the n.", 
    "So this whole thing--", 
    "", 
    "is 2 to the n over the size of the stabilizer group.",
