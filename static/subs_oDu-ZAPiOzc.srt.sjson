    "the fact that the sum of E sub k, dagger E sub k,", 
    "is equal to identity.", 
    "And that you don't need to have them be unitary or so forth,",

    "if I have a set--", 
    "an error E sub k, acting on code words, size of L,", 
    "this should not distinguish one code word", 
    "from another code word.", 
    "So this should be all the same value, let's call this d sub k,", 
    "for all the code words.", 
    "That is, if identity did something to a qubit", 
    "and then an error, like an x error, changes it,", 
    "by a different amount, I say, because the probabilities", 
    "are different, then it's going to shrink one vector compared", 
    "with other vector.", 
    "So this is going to take a vector space that", 
    "looks like that into something that", 
    "might be a shrunken pancake.", 
    "That's no good because then you don't have a squared up Hilbert", 
    "space anymore, and so you can't correct it.", 
    "So these are the two conditions, orthogonality and", 
    "non-deformation.", 
    "And let me try to give you the proof of the statement.", 
    "The reason the proof is interesting", 
    "is because the proof is constructive.",

    "is going to be.", 
    "So you'll be able to see how to do it", 
    "and then you can believe that you can find", 
    "lots of error correction codes.", 
    "But what it belies is that in actual practice,", 
    "the Hilbert space has grown so large so fast", 
    "that it's actually hard to find good quantum codes just", 
    "by exhaustively searching for them.", 
    "Still, let's work through the proof", 
    "and then maybe you'll also see ways", 
    "of making them simpler on different kinds of states", 
    "that have specific patterns.", 
    "So let's define P as being the trajectory into the cold space.", 
    "", 
    "I often use this as a short cut notation for density matrices.", 
    "It's not an x if this is a [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "This is the projector onto the cold space C.", 
    "And I want to note a fact here, which is useful for us", 
    "algebraically as we go through the proof, that", 
    "is if I project a given error--", 
    "two errors, so I'm going to have a state that has error Ej,", 
    "and I have another state that has error E sub", 
    "k, if I look at the overlap of this thing,", 
    "then this is going to be equal to d sub k, delta J k P", 
    "by virtue of combining these two statements over here.", 
    "So the delta comes from this, so you only", 
    "get something that's non-zero when j is not equal to k.", 
    "And you get the same thing for all code words, D sub k,", 
    "from the non-deformation condition.", 
    "So this is a restatement of the theorem", 
    "over here in one very concise mathematical statement.", 
    "Also, a beautiful fact from matrix theory", 
    "known as the polar decomposition gives us", 
    "a way of taking some strange operator, matrix operator,", 
    "and decomposing that into a part, which is a rotation,", 
    "and a part which is like a shrinking part.", 
    "And so by the polar decomposition", 
    "of this particular operator, which", 
    "is E sub k P, will take an error,", 
    "E sub k is one of the errors in this notation up here,", 
    "so it might be a bit flip or phase flip, or something else,", 
    "if Y.", 
    "I can still describe this as some unitary part", 
    "and some non-unitary part.", 
    "I'll define the unitary part as U sub k,", 
    "and the recipe for the polar decomposition", 
    "states that I just square this and take its square root.", 
    "So p E sub k, dagger, E sub k P. But by this restatement", 
    "of the theorem here, we have that this is just", 
    "the square root of d sub k times U sub k P.", 
    "So here the kk gives you a 1 for the delta function,", 
    "and then the dk moves over like that.", 
    "So this is the rotation that an arrow causes.", 
    "This is the shrinkage that the error causes,", 
    "and we continue to project it into the cold space.", 
    "So now I can give you the two parts of the theorem", 
    "by constructing the syndrome measurement.", 
    "", 
    "And then the recovery operator.", 
    "So for the syndrome operation measurement,", 
    "let me define a projection into a specific rotated code space.", 
    "So the intuition is, I'm going to take the different color", 
    "spaces over here that are orthogonal to each other", 
    "because of this first condition, and I'm", 
    "going to rotate them all back into the same place.", 
    "So I take this one, I rotate it here,", 
    "I take another error operator version, I rotate it over here,", 
    "and so forth.", 
    "So they all fall on top of each other.", 
    "So that's U sub k P U sub k dagger.", 
    "This is the original cold space, and then this", 
    "is rotating it by the unitary rotation", 
    "part of each one of the errors.", 
    "And by plugging that in, I can rewrite", 
    "this in two different forms.", 
    "E sub k P over d sub k square root.", 
    "So this is taking P U sub k dagger,", 
    "so it's taking the U sub k P part over here.", 
    "Use sub k dagger, or I can take the second half of this", 
    "and it gives me U sub k P E sub k dagger", 
    "divided by d sub k square root.", 
    "", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now, by this statement up here, which I'll call star,", 
    "the P sub k are orthogonal.", 
    "", 
    "By this I mean that for all j not equal to k.", 
    "So two different errors instead of just the same error, P sub j", 
    "times P sub k is proportional to--", 
    "let's now just multiply this out together.", 
    "That's U sub k P E sub k, dagger, that's this term here,", 
    "taken with the U on the left-hand side", 
    "on this expression.", 
    "And then we'll take the j part over here, e sub j, P U sub j.", 
    "And then there's all over a d sub k.", 
    "But now we have from here that this", 
    "is orthogonal to each other by the same end of the theorem.", 
    "So this is equal to 0.", 
    "So the syndrome measurement is to just measure", 
    "P sub k and you obtain k.", 
    "k is just the syndrome operator.", 
    "I think we're almost done.", 
    "The recovery operator is going to be just U sub k dagger.", 
    "We take the unitary part of the error and you rotate it back.", 
    "And I claimed that this will fix what you want, fix the state.", 
    "So the recovery operator applied to some impedance matrix,", 
    "or be the sum over k of U sub k P sub k ro P sub k.", 
    "This is the syndrome measurement,", 
    "this is the unitary operator that you", 
    "apply based on the syndrome measurement, U sub k dagger.", 
    "And I'm going to work out this expression", 
    "and show that that's going to give you the result.", 
    "All I need is two lines of algebra.", 
    "", 
    "For a state that's a code word state,", 
    "then U sub k dagger P sub k E j side--", 
    "so an error applied to the code word state,", 
    "then projected and then rotated, is--", 
    "if you work out the algebra, the square root of D", 
    "sub k, delta j k times the original state.", 
    "And so if you plug this back into here,", 
    "you'll find that this is equal to the sum--", 
    "I'm just going to jump to the end here.", 
    "d sub k delta jk psi, psi.", 
    "The delta, I already sum.", 
    "", 
    "And it goes away.", 
    "Now, this is original state, but it shrunk by a little bit.", 
    "But this term is equal to 1 because these operators that we", 
    "had, sum over k, E sub k, dagger E sub k, is equal to identity.", 
    "So this is equal to the state the [INAUDIBLE] So that's",
