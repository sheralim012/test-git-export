    "", 
    "Let us begin with a description of quantum mechanics,", 
    "and a brief overview of elements of quantum circuits.", 
    "The basic elements we need for this course", 
    "are captured entirely by four postulates.", 
    "They cover states, gates, measurement, and composition.", 
    "Postulate 1 describes how states are", 
    "defined in the context of isolated physical systems.", 
    "Basically, we take any system such as a spin one half,", 
    "and represent it as a state vector within a Hilbert space,", 
    "which is an inner product vector space.", 
    "The state space may have an infinite number of dimensions.", 
    "For example, such as with a harmonic oscillator system.", 
    "You may also be quite familiar from quantum mechanics", 
    "with the use of continuous variables, such as position,", 
    "in describing the quantum states.", 
    "However, in our study of quantum information science,", 
    "we will largely be interested in discrete Hilbert spaces.", 
    "Keep in mind that these Hilbert spaces", 
    "are complex vector spaces with an inner product that", 
    "is defined.", 
    "States are thus vectors, such as this zero state being", 
    "1,0 and the one state being 0,1, two component vectors which", 
    "are spinors, or are otherwise known as qubits", 
    "in quantum information science.", 
    "So that tells us about states.", 
    "Let us now move on to Postulate 2, which talks about gates.", 
    "Gates describe the evolution of closed quantum systems, i.e.", 
    "isolated systems, and thus will be unitary transforms.", 
    "Specifically, the unitary transform", 
    "will govern how a state psi evolves from the initial time,", 
    "t1, to some final time, t2.", 
    "Psi 1 and psi 2 are thus related by a matrix U which", 
    "multiplies a state vector psi 1 to produce a state vector", 
    "psi 2.", 
    "This unitary transform has a property", 
    "that U dagger U is equal to identity,", 
    "namely that it is a unitary matrix.", 
    "Describing quantum gates is a core concept", 
    "for quantum circuits.", 
    "Thus, let us consider a few examples of quantum gates.", 
    "Specifically, let us look at the action of a few common quantum", 
    "gates on qubits.", 
    "Recall the state zero.", 
    "The X gate-- 0,1, 1,0, a two by two", 
    "matrix-- acts on the zero state to give the one state,", 
    "as is shown by this simple matrix multiplication.", 
    "Thus, this X gate may be considered the quantum analog", 
    "of the classical NOT gate.", 
    "A really uniquely quantum gate is this transform,", 
    "which is described by the two by two matrix 1,1, 1, minus 1.", 
    "This is the Hadamard gate.", 
    "The Hadamard gate acts on 0 to give", 
    "a superposition of 0 and 1, an equal superposition", 
    "with coefficients 1 over square root of 2.", 
    "That is, the two-component vector 1 over", 
    "square root of 2, 1 over square root of 2.", 
    "You can check for yourself that the Hadamard operator", 
    "is its own inverse.", 
    "OK.", 
    "The example we just finished was a gate", 
    "acting on a single qubit space.", 
    "Let us now look at a slightly more complicated example", 
    "of a gate acting on a slightly larger Hilbert space.", 
    "This is a state in a four-dimensional Hilbert", 
    "space with four coefficients, which are arbitrary.", 
    "Of course, subject to normalization.", 
    "We may also write the state as a sum over basis vectors, which", 
    "are labeled 0 through 3 with coefficient c sub x rather than", 
    "a through d. That's the same.", 
    "We may also write it as a four component", 
    "vector in this inner product Hilbert space.", 
    "The unitary transform we'll look at", 
    "is this four by four matrix with 0s and 1s.", 
    "Note that the columns and rows are", 
    "labeled by the same basis vectors as in the state", 
    "that we just described.", 
    "Thus, the first column and row act", 
    "on the top-most label, and the bottom right", 
    "acts on the bottom label.", 
    "We can therefore work out straightforwardly by a matrix", 
    "multiplication that the action of U on psi", 
    "is to flip the labels 2 and 3.", 
    "This should not be a surprise, because after all U", 
    "is a permutation matrix.", 
    "So it permutes the labels of the state.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now that we have gone through two gate examples,", 
    "let us move on to Postulate 3.", 
    "This postulate describes measurements.", 
    "Measurements are going to be described", 
    "by a collection of measurement operators, M sub m.", 
    "And these operators act in the state space of the system being", 
    "measured with an index m.", 
    "The index describes some possible measurement outcomes", 
    "that may occur when the measurement is done.", 
    "M occurs with probability given by an inner product", 
    "of the state being measured and the measurement operator.", 
    "Measurement changes the quantum state.", 
    "If an initial state psi is measured,", 
    "then the post-measurement state is given by this expression.", 
    "Basically, a product of M with a state", 
    "divided by the probability of the measurement result being", 
    "obtained.", 
    "It is important to keep in mind that these Ms are", 
    "pretty arbitrary.", 
    "The only constraint is that the sum of M dagger M", 
    "must be identity.", 
    "The Ms need not be square.", 
    "For example, Ms may be projection operators.", 
    "The operator formed by the product of two Ms", 
    "may be familiar to you from a different context.", 
    "They are also known as positive operator-valued measures.", 
    "Measurements are something we will return to a great deal", 
    "later.", 
    "So for now, let us move on to the fourth postulate,", 
    "composition.", 
    "This is how we mathematically describe", 
    "how individual physical systems may", 
    "be described as a composite.", 
    "Mathematically, it is like digits.", 
    "These digits are tensor products for linear vector spaces.", 
    "For example, if we combine two qubit states,", 
    "there are four possible outcomes.", 
    "If we have n qubits, there are clearly", 
    "2 to the n possible outcomes.", 
    "And these are basis vectors for the new inner product Hilbert", 
    "space, which is the combination of the n qubits.", 
    "Let us look at some examples of composition.", 
    "Consider two qubits.", 
    "We may easily write them as two digits like this.", 
    "Sometimes, we'll explicitly write the tensor product", 
    "operator, as well.", 
    "A Hadamard operator acting on the two qubits written", 
    "like this represents the tensor product", 
    "of the Hadamard acting on the two individual qubits.", 
    "We may work out what that is explicitly simply", 
    "by taking the tensor product of the two superposition states.", 
    "Note that the tensor product distributes over addition.", 
    "Thus, this expression yields a superposition", 
    "over the four basis vectors.", 
    "Incidentally, it is common and convenient to represent", 
    "these binary vectors often by integers.", 
    "00 is 0.", 
    "01 is 1, et cetera, such that we may write this superposition", 
    "state also as a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3.", 
    "An expression common in quantum information science", 
    "is thus the use of n Hadamard operators acting on n qubits,", 
    "initially at 0, producing an equal superposition", 
    "over all basis vectors labeled from 0 to 2", 
    "to the n minus 1 written out as integers.", 
    "This is very useful.", 
    "x is just the set of all binary strings that have n bits.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Let's now also look at some examples", 
    "of tensor product structure described", 
    "with quantum circuits.", 
    "Here, I show a 0 qubit state going through a single Hadamard", 
    "gate, giving the equal superposition we've", 
    "previously seen.", 
    "We may do this twice, with two quantum circuits.", 
    "And this is simply described as the tensor product of the two.", 
    "Now, there is a much more interesting case", 
    "than two separate qubits undergoing gates like that.", 
    "Recall that we had looked at this unitary transform", 
    "on a four-dimensional Hilbert space.", 
    "We may also consider this unitary transform", 
    "as acting on a two qubit composite space.", 
    "So let's take two qubits, both in their zero state.", 
    "And we'll represent this transform", 
    "by the following circuit diagram.", 
    "That circuit symbol is known as a controlled NOT gate.", 
    "The first qubit controls whether a NOT,", 
    "an X gate, happens to the second qubit, the one on the bottom.", 
    "If we replace the first part of this circuit", 
    "with a Hadamard acting on a zero state,",
