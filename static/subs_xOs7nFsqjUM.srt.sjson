    "all the vectors in f2 to the 2n and that", 
    "are orthogonal to these.", 
    "And basically, every independent vector", 
    "here gives you a new constraint, which cuts down", 
    "the dimensionality by one.", 
    "So we're left with n plus k.", 
    "Right?", 
    "2n minus parenthesis n minus k.",

    "plus 2k from the logical operators.",

    "when I first saw this, I was very surprised by this fact.", 
    "But later I think it helps shed light", 
    "on the structure of these codes.",
